</div>

<p>The following pages are practically a reprint of a
volume which was issued for private circulation
some twelve months ago, under the title “The Religion
of Plutarch as expounded in his ‘Ethics.’” The main
difference between the present volume and its predecessor
consists in the translation or removal of various
quotations from Greek and Latin sources which were
given in full in the first edition of the book. The
references to these sources have, of course, been retained.
Verbal corrections have been made here and
there, and a few pages of new matter have been introduced
into the “Preface.” In other respects the two
impressions are substantially the same.</p>

<p>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without
expressing my gratitude to J. E. Sandys, Esq., Litt.D.,
Public Orator in the University of Cambridge, and
Examiner in Greek at the University of London, who
kindly placed at my disposal his own copy of the
original essay, in which he had made numerous
suggestions on points of style, and on questions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
scholarship in general. These suggestions have, for
the most part, been adopted in the preparation of the
present edition. My thanks are also owing to my
colleagues in the Civil Service, especially to those in
the General Post Office, London, to whose encouragement
it is largely due that this essay, in its present
form, is able to see the light.</p>

<p>As the <i>Athenæum</i>, in reviewing the original edition
(<i>Athenæum</i>, 2nd of August, 1902), suggested that “the
present essay is probably the forerunner of a larger and
more elaborate book,” it may be desirable to explain
that the following pages do not constitute “the larger
and more elaborate book” which the <i>Athenæum</i> is
right in forecasting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>When the student of Plutarch leaves the familiar
ground of the “Parallel Lives,” and turns, for
the first time, to the less thoroughly explored region
of the “Ethics,” he is struck with wonder at the
many-sided excellence of the writer whose special gift
he has been accustomed to regard as consisting in the
composition of biographies more remarkable for the
presentation of moral truths than for the accurate
narration of historical facts. He learns with surprise
that Plutarch has bequeathed to posterity a mine of
information respecting the period in which he himself
lived, as valuable and as interesting as the view
presented in his “Lives” of that higher antiquity in
which his classic heroes moved and worked. Even
the actual bulk of Plutarch’s contribution to what
may be called “general literature” is noteworthy.
Apart from the “Lives,” the so-called “Catalogue of
Lamprias” contains the titles of nearly two hundred
works attributed, ostensibly by his son, to Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and some fourscore of these have been handed down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
to our time under the general, but somewhat misleading,
title of “Ethica” or “Moralia.”</p>

<p>Among these surviving essays are to be found
contributions, of a surprising vitality and freshness, to
the discussion of Education, Politics, Art, Literature,
Music, Hygiene; serious and studied criticisms and
appreciations of the great philosophic schools of Greece
and their founders; short sermons on minor morals,
illustrated by vivid sketches of character both typical
and individual; conversations on Love and Marriage,
and on other topics perpetually interesting to civilized
societies. The longest work of all, the “Symposiacs,”
or “Table Talk,” besides containing a wealth of
material used by Plutarch and his friends in the
discussion of current problems of scientific, literary,
and social interest, gives a picture of Græco-Roman
Society in the first Christian century, which, both
from its general character and from the multitude of
details it contains on matters of fact, is of the utmost
importance for the accurate study of the period and
its complicated problems. All these various works
are interpenetrated with the character of the writer
to such a vivid degree of personality that their study,
from this point of view alone, would probably cast
more light upon Plutarch’s methods as a writer of
history than innumerable minute and difficult inquiries
into his “sources,” and the manner in which he used
them in writing his “Lives.”</p>

<p>Fascinating, however, as is the study of the “Ethics”
in these various aspects, it soon becomes evident that
the point of paramount importance for a proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
appreciation of Plutarch’s attitude towards life and
its problems in general, is to be found in the position
which he assumed in face of the religious questions
which perplexed the thinking men of his time and
country. What was Plutarch’s view of that ancient
and hereditary faith which was not only the official
creed of the Empire, but which was still accepted as
a sufficient spiritual satisfaction by many millions of
the Empire’s subjects? Was it possible that a man
so steeped in the best literature, so keen a student of
the greatest philosophies, could be a believer, to any
serious extent, in those traditions which appear so
crude and impossible in the light of our higher modern
ideals? And if he could think them worthy of credit,
by what method of interpretation was this consummation
facilitated? How could he persuade himself and
others to find in them at once the sanction and the
inspiration of virtuous conduct? These are some of
the questions which are constantly before the mind
of the reader as he turns the pages of the “Ethics,”
and they are constantly before the mind of the reader
because the author is constantly supplying materials
for answering them. The most important of Plutarch’s
general writings are devoted to the full discussion,
from a variety of standpoints, of religious questions,
not only those handed down by the popular tradition,
or embodied in ceremonial observances and legalized
worships, but also those more purely theological
conceptions presented in the various systems of Greek
Philosophy. Around Plutarch’s Religion revolves his
conception of life; his numerous contributions to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
discussion of other subjects of human interest unfold
their full significance only when regarded in the light
supplied by a knowledge of his religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Such, at any rate, is the experience of the present
writer after a close study of the “Ethics” during
several years; and it is with the hope of contributing
in some degree to the clearer appreciation of Plutarch’s
manifold activities in other directions, that an investigation
into his religious views has been made the special
object of the following pages.</p>

<p>The text which has been used for the purposes of
this essay is that issued at intervals between the years
1888 and 1896 by Mr. G. N. Bernardakis, the director
of the Gymnasium at Mytilene.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The editor has
postponed, for discussion in a subsequent work, many
questions bearing upon the authority of his MSS., and
the principles which he has applied to them in the
choice of his readings; his efforts in the <i>editio minor</i>
having been almost wholly confined to presenting the
results of his labours in the shape of a complete and
coherent text. Although, as Dr. Holden has said,
“until the appearance of the promised <i>editio major</i> it
is premature to pronounce an opinion on the editor’s
qualifications as a textual critic,”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> yet Mr. Bernardakis
has exhibited so much combined accuracy and acumen
in the preliminary discussion of various questions
connected with his collation of MSS., and has disposed
so completely, as Dr. Holden admits, of the charges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
of inaccuracy brought against him by Professor von
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff of Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that the more
general student of Classical Literature may, perhaps,
feel some amount of confidence that in this edition he
sees the actual work of Plutarch himself, and not the
ingenious and daring conjectures of some too brilliant
critic. This feeling of confidence will not be diminished
by the evident anxiety displayed by Mr. W. R. Paton,
an English scholar working in the same field, “to
induce Mr. Bernardakis to assist and correct” him
in editing a text of the “De Cupiditate Divitiarum,”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and it will be increased by the discovery that, greatly
different as the text of Bernardakis is from that of
any other previous edition, the difference frequently
consists in the substitution of plain sense for undiluted
absurdity, or total want of meaning.</p>

<p>Indebtedness to other sources of criticism and
information is, the writer hopes, fully acknowledged
in the footnotes as occasion arises. There has yet been
published no work in English dealing with Plutarch’s
“Ethics” at all similar in scope and character either
to Volkmann’s “Leben, Schriften und Philosophie des
Plutarch von Chæronea,”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or to Gréard’s “La Morale
de Plutarque.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Archbishop Trench, who speaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
slightingly of Gréard’s interesting study, has himself
contributed one or two “Lectures” to some general
observations on this sphere of Plutarch’s activity,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
while the Rev. J. P. Mahaffy has given two chapters
to the subject in his “Greek World under Roman
Sway.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Chap. xiii., which is headed “Plutarch
and His Times—Public Life,” is devoted partly to
Apuleius, and partly to Plutarch himself, and exhibits,
in continuous form, a number of that author’s best-known
and most frequently quoted statements and
opinions on the subjects of Politics and Religion,
some ten pages being set apart for the presentation
and criticism of his views on the latter topic. Chap.
xiv. is entitled “Plutarch and His Times—Private
Life,” and intersperses with comments a number of
extracts from the evidence furnished by Plutarch on
various matters appertaining to the social and domestic
life of his epoch, giving the gist of passages selected
from the “Table Talk,” from various essays on
Education, and from several tracts on Minor Morals
and other themes of general interest.</p>

<p>Although Professor Mahaffy’s prolonged and extensive
researches into every available sphere of Greek life and
thought occasionally enable him to help out his author’s
descriptions by aptly chosen illustrations from other
sources, yet, in dealing with a writer at once so
voluminous and so full of interest as Plutarch, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
historian is hampered by the necessary limits of his
appointed task, no less than by his own diffusive
and gossiping style. Mr. Mahaffy’s Clio has always
appeared to us in the light of an amiable and cultured
hostess presiding at Afternoon Tea, gliding graciously
hither and thither among her guests, and introducing
topics of conversation which have only a superficial
interest, or which she presents only in their superficial
aspects; while, perhaps unconsciously, conveying the
impression that she reserves for discussion among a
few chosen intimates the more profound and sacred
issues of human life. These two chapters on Plutarch
furnish an excellent example of Professor Mahaffy’s
method. They are entertaining in the sense that all
well-conducted gossip is entertaining. A trait of
character is chosen here; a smart saying, or a foolish
one, is selected there; a piquant anecdote is retold
elsewhere: but the searchlight is never stationary,
and the earnest student who trusts solely to its
assistance will vainly attempt to see Plutarch steadily
and see him whole.</p>

<p>It is, of course, the fact, as already suggested, that,
in these chapters, Professor Mahaffy is dealing with
Plutarch only so far as he furnishes material illustrative
of the conception which the historian has formed as
to the character of the age in which his subject lived.
This fact is conspicuously evident in the brief account
of Plutarch’s Religion given in the ten pages from
page 311 onwards, where Professor Mahaffy accepts
the belief of so many of his predecessors, that the age
was an age of religious decadence, and not an age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
religious revival; and that, moreover, it was blameworthy
in Plutarch that “he never took pains to
understand” Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Further, it must be added,
that the historian’s natural desire to illustrate Plutarch’s
times, rather than to display Plutarch himself, has
led him to commit serious injustice by his uncritical
acceptance of certain spurious tracts as the genuine
workmanship of Plutarch.</p>

<p>The conclusion at which Professor Mahaffy arrives,
that Plutarch was “a narrow and bigoted Hellene,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
is intelligible enough to those who accept the view
which we have endeavoured to combat in Chapter III.
of the following essay, a view which is simply a
belated survival of the ancient prejudice which consigns
to eternal perdition the followers of other Religions,
because they are wilfully blind to the light with which
our own special Belief has been blessed in such splendour.
But the man who, after even the most casual
study of Plutarch’s utterances on Religion, can seriously
describe him as “narrow and bigoted” will maintain,
with equal serenity, that it is the practice of the sun
to shine at midnight. Professor Mahaffy, indeed, in
using such expressions, is at variance with his own
better judgment, inasmuch as he elsewhere concedes
that, “had Plutarch been at Athens when St. Paul
came there, he would have been the first to give the
Apostle a respectful hearing.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span></p>

<p>The subject of Plutarch’s “Moralia” has also been
touched in a few contributions to the current Literature
of the Reviews. The article on “Plutarch” appearing
over Paley’s initials in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,”
and giving a brief statement of the subjects dealt
with in the different tracts in the “Moralia,” almost
entirely exhausts the short list of English literary contributions
to the treatment of this portion of Plutarch’s
work. Paley declared in the article in question that
the “Moralia” were “practically almost unknown to
most persons in Britain, even to those who call themselves
scholars.” This sweeping assertion is not by
any means true to-day, although it is still the case
that, so far as the literary presentment of results is
concerned, the “Ethics” of Plutarch are a neglected
field of research.</p>

<p>Volkmann, in the “Leben und Schriften” part of
his work, carefully discusses the authenticity of each
tract in the generally recognized list of Plutarch’s
writings, while in the volume dealing with the
“Philosophie” he gives an exhaustive analysis of
the greater portion of them. Recognizing that Plutarch
had no special philosophical system of his own,
Volkmann endeavours to remedy this deficiency by
the application of a systematic method of treatment
with regular branches of “synthetic” and “analytic”
investigation. The “synthetic” branch of Volkmann’s
method is devoted to a discussion of Plutarch’s
philosophic standpoint; to an examination of his
polemic against the Stoics and Epicureans; and to the
consideration of his relation to Plato, which Volkmann<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
regards as the foundation of Plutarch’s Philosophy.
The function of Volkmann’s “analytic” method is to
discover how, on the philosophic basis thus laid down
by the “synthetic” method, Plutarch arranges his
positive conclusions in a coherent relationship with
his negative polemic. It is, according to Volkmann,
a natural result of the successful operation of this
twofold system, that the circumstances of Plutarch’s
life lose their external character, and attain to an
essential connexion with his philosophical conceptions.
This last assertion is made by way of criticism directed
against Gréard’s “natural and simple” method of
arranging Plutarch’s philosophical utterances under
headings descriptive of the various spheres of life to
which they seem appropriate—“<i>la vie domestique</i>,”
“<i>la cité</i>,” “<i>le temple</i>,” &amp;c. Volkmann thinks that
under this arrangement the sense of internal unity is
lost; that Plutarch’s views are presented in it as
goodnatured and benevolent, but somewhat rambling,
reflections on the separate aspects of human life,
instead of being treated as the outcome of a consistent
philosophy taking ethical phenomena into systematic
consideration.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This criticism has considerable force,
though it does not detract from the truth and charm
of M. Gréard’s book. Volkmann himself undoubtedly
errs in the opposite direction. Gréard was quite
justified in retorting on his critic, “<i>Il arrive même qu’en
voulant établir trop</i> rationellement <i>la philosophie de
Plutarque, M. Volkmann se trouve conduit à lui prêter
une sorte de système, bien qu’il sache comme personne que<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
nul moins que le sage de Chéronée n’a porté dans ses
écrits une pensée systématique</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Volkmann, in our
opinion, attaches far too much importance both to
Plutarch’s discipular relation to Plato, and to his
polemic against the Stoics and Epicureans. Plutarch’s
opposition to Plato is frequently as strongly marked
as his opposition to Stoics and Epicureans; and his
indebtedness to Stoics and Epicureans is frequently as
strongly marked as his indebtedness to Plato.</p>

<p>Volkmann’s work had been preceded in 1854 by
an interesting and well-written Thesis, entitled “De
Apologetica Plutarchi Chæronensis Theologia.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
author, C. G. Seibert, gives a brief review of Greek
Philosophy, with the object of showing the attitude
assumed by each of the great schools to the gods of
the national tradition. He demonstrates conclusively,
and Volkmann follows in his steps, that Plutarch owed
something to all the Schools, to Stoics, to Peripatetics,
and to Epicureans. Yet he, too, insists that Plutarch’s
attitude towards the popular religion was identical
with that assumed by Plato—<i>eadem ratione (qua Plato)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
Platonis discipuli theologiam tractarunt, e quibus præ
cœteris Plutarchus magistri divini vestigia secutus est</i>.
This, indeed, is the orthodox tendency in the appreciation
of Plutarch, and it has been carried to the extent
of claiming Plutarch as the founder of that special
kind of Platonism distinguished by the epithet “New.”
“Plutarch,” says Archbishop Trench, “was a Platonist
with an oriental tinge, and thus a forerunner of the
New Platonists.”—“He might be described with greater
truth than Ammonius as the Founder of Neo-Platonism,”
wrote Dr. H. W. J. Thiersch, who, however, had not
freed himself from the idea (the truth of which even
so early a writer as Dacier had doubted, and the
legendary character of which M. Gréard has proved
beyond a doubt) that Plutarch received consular
honours at the hands of Trajan.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—“In this essay”
(the <i>De Oraculorum Defectu</i>), thinks Mr. W. J. Brodribb,
“Plutarch largely uses the Neo-Platonic Philosophy.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Even those who do not insist that Plutarch is a Neo-Platonist,
or a “forerunner” of Neo-Platonism, are
so anxious to label him with some designation, that
they will hardly allow him to speak for himself. It
may, perhaps, argue presumption on the part of an
<i>homo incognitus nulliusque auctoritatis</i> to suggest that
Plutarch faces the teaching of his predecessors with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
independent mind; that he is <i>nullius addictus jurare
in verba magistri</i>; that he tries Plato’s teachings, not
from Plato’s point of view, but from his own.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Such, however, is the view maintained in the pages
of the following essay. It seems to us that, in order
to discover the principle which gives coherence and
internal unity to Plutarch’s innumerable philosophic
utterances, it is not necessary to start with the
assumption that he belongs to any particular school.
Philosophy is to him one of the recognized sources of
Religion and Morality. Tradition is another source,
and Law or recognized custom another. Plutarch
assumes that these three sources conjointly supply
solid sanctions for belief and conduct. They are the
three great records of human experience, and Plutarch
will examine all their contributions to the criticism
of life with a view to selecting those parts from each
which will best aid him and his fellow citizens to lead
lives of virtue and happiness. The great philosophical
schools of Greece are regarded from this point of view—from
the point of view of a moralist and a philosopher,
not from the point of view of a Platonist, an anti-Stoic,
or an anti-Epicurean. Plutarch is indebted, as even
Volkmann himself shows, to all the Schools alike.
Then why call him a Platonist, or a Neo-Pythagorizing
Platonist, as Zeller has done? Plutarch’s teaching is
too full of logical inconsistencies to be formalized into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
a system of Philosophy. But the dominating principle
of his teaching, the paramount necessity of finding a
sanction and an inspiration for conduct in what the
wisdom of the past had already discovered, is so
strikingly conspicuous in all his writings that his
logical inconsistencies appear, and are, unimportant.
It is this desire of making the wisdom and traditions
of the past available for ethical usefulness which
actuates his attempt to reconcile the contradictions, and
remove the crudities and inconsistencies, in the three
sources of religious knowledge. This is the principle
which gives his teaching unity, and not any external
circumstances of his life, or his attitude in favour of
or in opposition to the tenets of any particular school.</p>

<p>There is no English translation of Plutarch’s
“Ethics” which can claim anything approaching the
character of an authorized version. Almost every
editor of Plutarch has felt it necessary to find fault
with his predecessors’ attempts to express Plutarch’s
meaning through the medium of another language.
Amyot’s translation is, in the opinion of the Comte
Joseph de Maistre, repellent to “ladies and foreigners.”
Wyttenbach, who makes numerous alterations of
Xylander’s Latin version, also says of Ricard’s French
translation, that “it skips over the difficulties and
corruptions in such a manner as to suggest that the
translator was content merely to produce a version
which should be intelligible to French readers.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
Wyttenbach himself is reprehended in the following
terms by the editor of the Didot text of the “Moralia”—“Of
the Latin version, in which we have made numerous
corrections, it must be admitted that Xylander and
Wyttenbach, in dealing with corrupt passages, not
infrequently translated conjectures of their own, or
suggested by other scholars, which we have been
unable to adopt into the Greek Text.” In the preface
to his English translation of the “De Iside et Osiride,”
the Rev. Samuel Squire, Archdeacon of Bath in 1744,
has some excellent critical remarks on the style of
previous translators of Plutarch, and he somewhat
pathetically describes the difficulties awaiting the
author who endeavours to translate that writer—“<i>To
enter into another man’s Soul as it were, who lived
several hundred years since, to go along with his thoughts,
to trace, pursue, and connect his several ideas, to express
them with propriety in a language different from that
they were conceived in, and lastly to give the copy the
air and spirit of an original, is not so easy a task as it
may be perhaps deemed by those who have never made
the attempt. The very few good translations of the
learned authors into our own language, will sufficiently
justify the truth of the observation—but if any one still
doubts it, let him take the first section of the book before
him, and make the experiment himself.</i>” M. Gréard is
briefer but equally emphatic—“<i>Toute traduction est
une œuvre délicate, celle de Plutarque plus que toute
autre peut-être</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span></p>

<p>Whatever may be the cause of the perpetuation of
this ungracious tradition of fault-finding, whether the
general difficulty specified by Archdeacon Squire, or the
more particular obstacle of a corrupt text described by
other commentators, we do not feel that we are called
upon to make any departure from so long-established a
custom. The quaint charm of most of the translations
forming the basis of Dr. Goodwin’s revision no one
will be inclined to deny, although the reviser’s own
remarks make it clear that little dependence is to be
placed upon their accuracy in any instance of difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The two volumes contained in the well-known “Bohn”
series of translations are utterly misleading, not only
as regards the colour which they infuse into Plutarch’s
style, but also as regards their conspicuous incorrectness
in many particular instances.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> To other translations
of individual tracts reference has been occasionally
made in the notes.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that no dependence was to
be placed upon the accuracy of any translation yet
furnished of that portion of our author’s work with
which we were dealing, it was necessary, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
undertaking this essay, to make full translations of
considerable portions of the “Ethics” from the text
of Bernardakis; and these translations, or paraphrases
based upon them, are largely employed in the following
pages. Mere references to the text in support of
positions assumed, or statements made, would have
been useless and misleading in the absence of clear
indications as to the exact interpretation placed upon
the words of the text. The writer cannot hope to have
succeeded where, in the opinion of competent judges,
there have been so many failures. But he has, at any
rate, made a conscientious attempt to understand his
author, and to give expression to his view of his
author’s meaning, without any prejudice born of the
assumption that Plutarch belonged to a particular
school, or devoted his great powers of criticism and
research to the exposition and illustration of the
doctrines of any single philosopher.</p>

<h1><span class="smaller">THE</span><br>
RELIGION OF PLUTARCH</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p><i>General character of Modern European Religions: their cardinal
appeal to Emotion—Roman Religion: its sanctions chiefly
rational: the causes of its failure: its place as a factor in
Morality taken by Greek Philosophy—Early Greek Morality
based partly on Religion, partly on Reason, which, in the form
of Philosophy, eventually supplies the main inspiration to
Goodness—Gradual limitation of Philosophy to Ethics.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The various religious revivals which the European
world has witnessed during the prolonged course
of the Christian era; the great attempts which the
modern conscience has made from time to time to bring
itself into a more intimate and fruitful relation with
the principles that make for goodness of character
and righteousness of life: have, in general, taken the
form less of reasoned invocations to the cultivated
intelligence than of emotional appeals to the natural
passions and prepossessions of humanity. The hope
of reward, the fear of punishment, a spontaneous love
of certain moral qualities, and of certain personalities
imagined as embodying these qualities; a heartfelt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
hatred of certain moral defects, and of certain personalities
imagined as embodying these defects:—such are
the feelings that have formed the strength of every
movement which has in turn agitated the religious
life of the Western world from St. Paul to Wesley,
from St. Augustine to Cardinal Newman. What is
felt to be goodness is loved with a personal adoration
which is convinced that nothing in the world is of
import compared with the hope of one day touching
the mere hem of that garment of holiness, the mystic
effluence of which has already power to irradiate life
with a strange beauty and meaning. Any sanction
which imaginative piety or legendary authority can
lend to Virtue is credited, not because it makes Virtue
natural, intelligible, and human, but because it places
her on a pedestal beyond the reach of unaided mortal
effort, and thus compels a still more determined
recourse to emotional and supernatural sanctions in
order to ensure her fruitful cultivation. Hence
Tertullian will glory in the Crucifixion of Christ,
because in the eyes of reason it is shameful; and he
will proclaim the Resurrection as certain, because
reason condemns it as impossible.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Hence Augustine
will believe first, postponing the grave question whether
belief is likely to be supported by proof.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Hence that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
conception of saintliness which the world owes to
Catholic Christianity, a type of character which, while
maintaining a marvellous purity of life, is devoid of
that robust intelligence without which purity runs into
asceticism; which carries virtue to such an extravagant
pitch that its results may be more disastrous than those
of extravagant vice, inasmuch as the latter may serve
morality by demonstrating the repulsiveness of iniquity,
while the former tends to evil by exhibiting the impossibility
of goodness.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>This “<i>extravagance du christianisme</i>”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is, of course,
utterly at variance with the general character of the
efforts by which either a Greek or a Roman directed
his steps in the ways of goodness. Neither Aristotle
nor Horace, neither Plato nor Seneca, would have
admitted many of the most lauded virtues of modern
ethical systems to be virtues at all. Least of all would
they have hailed as a virtue that passionate excess of
enthusiasm which makes Virtue independent of Reason,
and greets intellectual impossibilities as the trials and
tests of the “virtue” of Belief.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Speaking in a general
sense, and with a tacit recognition of certain exceptions
to be noticed in their proper place, it may be premised
that Pagan goodness of character found its inspiration,
not in any kind of emotional enthusiasm, but in
methods of thought and action selected and controlled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
by the operation of reason and intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Horace’s
opinion respecting the viciousness of the man who
indulges in a too excessive love of virtue is the opinion,
if not of a Greek, at any rate of a Roman who is saturated
with Greek philosophy;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but the early character
of the poet’s countrymen, as evinced not less in their
Religion than in their general outlook on life, is as
little disposed to extravagance as the strongest advocate
of <i>aurea mediocritas</i> could well desire. Roman Religion,
influenced to some extent as it was by the gloomy
terrors of Etruscan superstition, found its value and
its meaning, from the gods of the Indigitamenta downwards,
in the fact that it was an appeal to the intelligence
of the citizen. That this appeal operated in a
narrow sphere of duties and was not unaffected by mean
and sordid considerations does not militate against
its general character as an address to the reason
rather than an invocation to the passions. Ancient
critics found for the word “<i>Religio</i>” a derivation which
pointed to carefulness and regularity as qualities
inherent in its essential meaning;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and that avoidance
of disordered excess, which tends to compromise, was as
conspicuous in early Roman religious practice as it was
in the sternest of Greek philosophies when transplanted
to Roman soil, and interpenetrated with the
Roman character.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This spirit of compromise was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
based upon a recognition that the actual demands of
practical life were of greater importance than the
maintenance of a rigid conformity to the letter of
religious precepts. Virgil, who was a participant in
the work of religious reform inaugurated by Augustus,
and who everywhere breathes a spirit of the most
careful reverence towards the ancient traditions of the
national faith, gives emphatic expression to this view
of the dominant claims of practical life, and of the
tolerant attitude which Religion assumes with regard to
them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quippe etiam festis quædam exercere diebus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fas et jura sinunt; rivos deducere nulla</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Relligio vetuit, segeti prætendere sæpem,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Insidias avibus moliri, incendere vepres,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Balantumque gregem fluvio mersare salubri.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This recognition of the principle that Duty has claims
which even Religion must concede is prominently
written on every page of Roman History. It indicates
the operation, in one direction, of that influence of
Reason on Religion which, in another direction, leads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
to the admission of a real divinity in the gods adored
by foreign peoples. The famous formula of Roman
Religion, which appealed to the protecting gods of
Carthage and its people to leave that city to its fate,
is an early anticipation of that hospitable tolerance, so
strange to modern sects, which welcomed Greek and
barbarian deities to the Roman Pantheon, and never
persecuted from religious motives.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This spirit had
its apotheosis in the endeavours of the reformers of the
age of Plutarch to establish the triumph of Reason in a
general recognition of the Unity of God beneath the
different names which expressed Him to different
peoples.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Although we cannot accept as actual history the particulars
given by Dionysius Halicarnassensis respecting
the manner in which Romulus established the principles
of Roman religious and political administration, considerable
value may be conceded to such an account,
because it is calculated to explain, from the writer’s
point of view, the existence of certain actual characteristics
of Roman civic and sacred polity.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Romulus is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
recorded as subjecting Religion to the selective power
of reason and good taste. Reason decides what it is
becoming for the Divine Nature to be, and everything
inconsistent with this salutary notion is rigidly excluded
from the State Religion. Romulus teaches the
Romans that the gods are good, and that their goodness
is the cause of man’s happiness and progress; he
instructs them in Temperance and Justice, as the bases
of civic concord, and of the advantages resulting therefrom;
he inculcates military Fortitude as the best
means of securing the undisturbed practice of the other
virtues, and the social blessings springing from such
practice; and he concludes that Virtue is not a matter
of chance, or the result of supernatural inspirations,
but the product of reasonable laws when zealously and
faithfully carried into practice by the citizens. Reason
is here clearly represented as the lawgiver of Religion,
and the cause and origin of the practical virtues.
Dionysius may, as we have suggested, be endeavouring
to explain, by an <i>ex post facto</i> piece of history, the
existence of certain characteristics of the Roman constitution
as exhibited in its later developments, but
these features are not the less evident and essential
parts of the system because we cannot accept any
particular account of the time and manner in which
they were incorporated with it.</p>

<p>Further, the Roman administrative authority deliberately
repressed the exhibition of religious enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
as dangerous to the stability of the Republic; the State
could brook no rival in her affections: the devotion of
Regulus<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the suppression of the Bacchanalia bear
equal witness to a firm insistence on the control of
personal emotion as a cardinal principle of Roman
administration.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The apparently paradoxical and casuistical
position assigned in the “De Natura Deorum”
to Cotta, who believes in the national religion as a
Roman while denying it as a philosopher, is sufficiently
lucid and rational when regarded in the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of the religious administration of Rome, which had
never claimed to enslave the intelligences of men, so
long as that elaborate ritual, with which the safety of
the State was involved, received due and reverential
attention.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Roman Religion, revolving round the
State in this way, and moulding the life of every
individual citizen into rigid external conformity with
the official ideal, showed its strength in the production
of a type of moral character which was perfect within
the iron limits fixed by the civic authority.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It was
dignified, austere, self-controlled, self-reverent. In the
absence of great temptations, such as assail the secret
strongholds of the human heart and lie beyond the
influence of any external power, the ancient <i>Virtus
Romana</i> was equal to all the demands which a somewhat
restricted code of ethics made upon it. But,
when a wider knowledge of the world brought with
it a weakening of the chain which bound the citizen
to the central power; when, at the same time, a wider
possession of the world and a richer enjoyment of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
pleasures increased to an enormous extent the temptations
directed against the purity and completeness of
the moral character:<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> then it became alarmingly clear
to thoughtful men that, unless the moral life was to
run to seed in vicious weeds of self-indulgence, it was
necessary to invoke the aid of a subtler and stronger
influence than that of the State, an influence capable of
varying its appeal in accordance with the infinitely
varying moral needs of individual men.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It was with
the hope of finding inspiration of this character that
Lucretius and Cicero turned the attention of their
countrymen to Greek Philosophy; it was there that
they wished to find an ampler and more direct sanction
in reason for cultivating a life of virtue. Reason, which
had not been devoid of effect in the narrow sphere
of Roman Religion, was now to be made the basis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of morality in general; but it was reason directed to
the purification and enlargement of the springs of
personal conduct, and calling into play qualities which
had lain dormant, or had been restricted, during the
long dominance of the State over the individual citizen.
To Regulus, his religion was the State; to Cicero, the
State and its demands form but a small fraction of the
moral life. A revival of Religion was to Cicero a
revival of Philosophy; Reason, the parent of Philosophy,
was also to be the parent of Conduct; the first of all
virtues is the virtue of Knowledge, of intelligent discrimination
between the things that make for morality
and happiness and the things that make for immorality
and misery.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Starting from this standpoint, Cicero,
though approaching Greek Philosophy more in the
spirit of the student than in that of the religious
reformer, though participating, as his Letters show,
in that general carelessness on religious matters
which marked Roman Society during the later years
of the Republic, was, nevertheless, the means of
giving a powerful stimulus to that movement in the
direction of deliberate personal morality, which became
conspicuous in the Græco-Roman world of the Early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Empire, and culminated under the fostering care of
Trajan and the Antonines. It then became clear that
Cicero had not looked in vain to Greek Philosophy to
save his countrymen from that moral degradation and
disorder which, in his own words, it demanded the
most earnest endeavours of every individual citizen to
check and restrain.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In Greece, Religion and Philosophy had early
enjoyed mutual relations of an intimate character.
The force of the weighty invocations which the poet
of the “Works and Days”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> addresses to his dishonourable
brother Perses lies less in the conventional theology
which alludes to the wrath of “broad-sighted Zeus”
as tracking the footsteps of the wicked, than in the
reasoned choice which the sinner is invited to make
between Injustice as leading inevitably to ruin, and
Virtue leading as inevitably to prosperity;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and the
claims of individual judgment, the right of every man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to subject everything to the test of his own intelligence,
never found finer expression than in the verse which
assigns the palm of moral perfection to him who has
the courage to think for himself.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Pindar, the most
religious poet of antiquity, applies the test of reason
to the established myths of Hellas when he refuses to
credit such legends as depict the gods in unseemly
situations, or under the influence of degrading passions.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Xenophanes thought that the claims of Religion and
Morality could be best advanced by cleansing the
moral atmosphere of the gods whose recorded lives
were so flagrantly in opposition to the dictates of
purity, reason, and honour; a strain of criticism which
found its most striking and notorious expression in the
famous Second and Third Books of Plato’s “Republic,”
but which had not been without its exponents among
more whole-hearted adherents of the national Religion.
But, meanwhile, the national Religion, as embodied,
at least, in the national liturgy, had been coming to
terms with the growing strength of Philosophy, and
the vestibules of the Temple at Delphi were inscribed
with those famous philosophical apophthegms, whose
presence there subsequently enabled Plutarch to claim
that Apollo was not only a God and a Seer, but a
Philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The popular morality of the days of
Socrates, which supplied his cross-examinees with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
ready-made answers to questions on the nature of
Vice and Virtue, and of the vices and the virtues,
was composed as much of Philosophy as of Religion
in the narrower sense of the term.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The Theogonies
of Homer and Hesiod furnished the external machinery
of the supernatural world, but the moral utterances of
these two poets, and not of these only, but of Simonides
and Solon, of Theognis and the “Seven Sages,” contained
many striking lessons, and many emphatic
warnings, touching the necessity and advantages of
a life of virtue. It became, in fact, quite evident,
though not, of course, explicitly asserted, or perhaps
even consciously admitted, that the gods, as represented
in the Homeric poems and as existing in the popular
imagination, were quite impossible as a foundation for
Morality, though surpassingly splendid as the material
of Art. It is hardly too much to say that, after the
establishment of the great philosophic schools in the
fourth century, all the conscious inspiration to a life
of Virtue, and all the consolations which it is the more
usual function of Religion to administer, were supplied
by Philosophy. Sudden conversions from Vice to
Philosophy mark the history of the philosophic movement
in Greece as religious movements have been
marked among other peoples and in other periods.
An edifying discourse under a Stoic Portico, or in an
Academic School, has been as effective in its practical
results as a religious oration by Bossuet, or a village
preaching by Whitfield.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Religion and Philosophy are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
identified, because both are identical with Morality;
the lives of some Greek Philosophers furnish the
nearest parallel attained in antiquity to the modern
ideal of saintliness.</p>

<p>This application of Philosophy to the spiritual
requirements of the individual man, this independence
of supernatural sanctions for goodness, was aided by
the almost purely liturgical character of the Greek
Religion. Greek Religion made no special appeal to
the individual conscience with a view to awakening
that sense of personal responsibility for every part
of one’s life and conduct which is the very soul and
centre of Religion as understood in modern days. To
attend the traditional religious festivals; to fulfil the
rites prescribed for certain occasions by the sacerdotal
laymen who represented the State on its religious side;
to hold a vague conventional notion respecting the
existence of the gods and of their separate personalities;
to listen quietly, and respond reverently, while the
purple-robed, myrtle-crowned, altar-ministrant intoned
with solemn resonance the ancient formulæ embalming
the sacred legends of some deity whose “Mysteries”
were specially fostered and honoured by the State; to
aid in giving effect to the dreadful imprecations pronounced
against those guilty of sacrilege or parricide;
to respond, in a word, to all the external demands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the national faith as a political institution: represented
the religious duty of a good and patriotic citizen. A
beautiful and impressive liturgy is, indeed, not without
effect in surrounding with a quiet atmosphere of goodness
a class of minds whose temptations are mercifully
proportioned to their weakness; but real moral worth
must spring from internal sources, and these internal
sources were not to be found in the Greek national
Religion. Hence a wider field for Philosophy in the
lives of a people whose eagerness in the pursuit of
virtue was as marked, if not so successful, as their
aspirations after perfection of art and profundity of
knowledge.</p>

<p>We do not ignore, in attributing this importance to
Philosophy as the inspiration of goodness, either that
fortunate class of people who, in Plato’s beautiful
expression, are “good by the divine inspiration of
their own nature,”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> or that more numerous section
of society who were directed into a certain common
conventional goodness by the moral influence of the
purer myths, and who were taught, like the youth in
Browning’s poem, “whose Father was a scholar and
knew Greek,” that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Their aim should be to loathe, like Peleus’ son,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But there was another side to the myths, a side less
favourable to the development of morals, and one
which had been brought forward so conspicuously in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the adverse criticisms of the philosophers that no one
could pretend to ignore its existence.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The prevailing
tendency of Greek myth was not moral, and it was
only after the most careful pruning, such, for example,
as that which Plutarch applies to it in his educational
essays, that myth became safely available as a factor
in ethical progress. The mainsprings of Conduct, of
personal and private Morality, are to be found in
Philosophy, and so great an importance did Philosophy
acquire as the instrument of goodness, that that
particular branch of Philosophy which exercised
surveillance over the realm of Conduct became eventually
recognized as Philosophy <i>par excellence</i>; the
overwhelming significance attached by Greek philosophers,
from the Sophists onwards, to the practical
element in their teaching, led to a restriction of the
terms “Philosophy” and “Philosopher” to an almost
purely ethical connotation. The argument in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
“Phædo” that, without Philosophy, Virtue is nothing
more than a mere rough sketch, is so strongly emphasized
in other quarters that there is formed a general

sphere of human conduct.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><i>Importance of the ethical tendency in pre-Socratic Philosophy
generally under-estimated—Development of this tendency from
Thales to the Sophists, and from the Sophists to the Stoics and
Epicureans—Special influence of these two Schools, aided by
the failure of political interest, in establishing a practicable
ideal of <span class="smcap">personal</span> virtue—This ideal, conspicuous in Plutarch’s
“Ethics,” and inculcated by the philosophers of the early
Græco-Roman Empire generally.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It will be interesting and useful briefly to trace the
growth of the ethical tendency in Greek Philosophy,
not only as a preparation for the study of Plutarch’s
position as an ethical and religious teacher, but also
because the prominence of this tendency in the pre-Socratic
systems appears to have been greatly underestimated.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
It has been found so easy, for purposes of
historical narrative, to describe a certain philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
tendency as “physical,” and a certain other as “metaphysical,”
that the purely general character of these
descriptions has been overlooked. Thales was a natural
philosopher, an astronomer, and, if we may trust the
“general belief of the Greeks” to which Herodotus
alludes in his account of the crossing of the river Halys
by Crœsus, a great mechanical engineer as well.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But
he was something more than this. He was distinguished
for great political insight, and was acknowledged
to be the greatest of the group of practical
philosophers who were known as the Seven Sages.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
To this group are assigned those famous dicta which,
whether inscribed by priests on the walls of temples,
or embodied by philosophers in their ethical systems,
conveyed a profound moral significance to every
member of a Hellenic community. Although no
special one of these sayings is ascribed to Thales by
name, it would surely be absurd to suppose him
deficient in those very qualities which brought fame
to the men at whose head he was universally placed.
A man who was confessedly a trusted counsellor in
Politics would assuredly, in those days, have had
something to say on that branch of Politics which was
destined eventually to be separated from its parent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
stem, and to become a distinct branch of philosophical
investigation. Anaximander cannot, at this distance of
time, be directly associated with the practical problems
of human life, but must ever remain wrapped up in his
“infinity,” which is neither Air nor Water, nor any
other element, but “something that is different from all
of them.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It is not, however, without significance in
this connexion, that the most striking fragment of his
Philosophy that has reached our times is couched in
ethical phraseology: “That out of which existing
things have their birth must also, <i>of right</i>, be their
grave when they are destroyed. For they must, by the
dispensation of time, <i>give a just compensation for their
injustice</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> We are in equal ignorance of any special
ethical teaching of Anaximenes. Heraclitus, however,
has a distinctly ethical aspect, in spite of the physical
nature of most of his philosophical speculations. Self-knowledge,
which is alien to the multitude, who are
under the sway of the poets,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is already, in Heraclitus,
the basis of self-control, as it is in Socrates the basis
of all moral excellence.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> An ordered self-control is the
highest of all virtues; even the Sun must not transgress
the limits of his sphere, or the Erinnyes, the
Ministers of <i>Justice</i>, will find him out.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Anaxagoras,
whom Sextus Empiricus will one day describe as “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
most <i>physical</i>” of all the philosophers, began his book
on Nature with the words “All things were in confusion
together; then came Intelligence, and gave them
order and arrangement;” thus laying the foundation
of his Natural Philosophy in a principle which could
not fail of early application to the sphere of Conduct.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
The denial of blind Chance, or of immutable Fate, in
the realm of physical phenomena easily leads to its
repudiation in the sphere of Ethics, and to a recognition
of the personal responsibility of the individual mind
for the consequences of its own decisions.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It was
probably a conviction of the ethical fruitfulness of the
principle thus laid down by Anaxagoras in the sphere
of Physics which induced Aristotle, the greatest of all
ethical philosophers, to assert that its author, as compared
with his predecessors, was a sober thinker by
the side of random babblers.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The physical investigations
of Democritus were utilized by the Epicureans to
free man from superstitious fears of another world, in
order that he might direct all his powers to making the
best of this world, in a moral, infinitely more than in a
physical, sense. He specifically discussed Virtue, and
concluded that happiness consisted in Temperance and
Self-Control.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In a book which he wrote under the
significant title of “Tritogeneia,” or “Minerva,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
appears to have applied the principle of Intelligence to
the domain of Ethics, as Anaxagoras had applied it to
the realm of Physics, pointing out that there wanted
three things to the perfection of human society—“to
reason well, to speak well, and to do one’s duty;” and
that these three powers all spring from the directing
influence of Intelligence. The author of the “Magna
Moralia” says that Pythagoras was the first to discuss
Virtue, and indicates in what manner the Pythagoreans
attempted to apply their theory of Number to the
sphere of Ethics. Their method was wrong, according
to the “Magna Moralia,” since there is a special and
appropriate method for the analysis and discussion of
the virtues, and “Justice is not a number evenly
even.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Such a definition, thus crushed by way of a
point-blank negative, has, of course, nothing but a
metaphorical significance as applied to Ethics; but the
metaphorical conception of Justice as a perfect number
will not be totally devoid of inspiration to justice of
conduct in the mind of one who loves perfection even
when represented by an arithmetical abstraction; and
if by this definition “it was designed to express the
correspondence between action and suffering,”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a fruitful,
though incomplete, ethical principle is embodied in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
their mathematical phrasing.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In a more general sense,
Epicharmus has sung how the Pythagorean Doctrine of
Number may be applied to the domain of practice:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Man’s life needs greatly Number’s ordered sway:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His path is safe who follows Number’s way.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the Pythagorean doctrine of Transmigration
probably had a greater ethical value than the metaphysical
conceptions of Number which constituted the
Pythagorean οὐσία; although it is not impossible that
the dogma, when carelessly held or unphilosophically
interpreted, might have a vicious rather than a virtuous
effect.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The “Golden Verses of Pythagoras,” whether
composed by any individual member of the school, or
officially embodying the teaching of the sect, or representing
the actual work of some philosopher not
formally a Pythagorean, have been universally recognised
to express a Pythagorean ideal;<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
exhibit in the doctrine of the Italian School a far more
vigorous and fruitful ethical tendency than any study
of its official doctrines—so far as they are available for
study—would lead us to suppose. And, indeed, the
followers of this Philosophy were conspicuous, even in
Plato’s time, for a special manner of life, the preparation
for which involved a strenuous devotion to a strict
and lofty ethical ideal, an ideal which subsequently
formed no small part of the strength of that last school
of Greek Philosophy which nominally sheltered under
the ægis of Plato.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Among the philosophers of the Eleatic School we
find an equally marked tendency in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Ethics. The very basis of the anti-theistic propaganda
of Xenophanes is that the gods in their traditional
character do not display those virtues which are
incumbent on even ordinarily decent men. To his
strenuous sincerity the removal of the gods from the
sphere of human conduct meant the introduction of a
stricter and better reasoned sanction for morality.
Even Parmenides and Melissus and Zeno were not so
absorbed in the creation of abstract metaphysical
conceptions but that Plutarch is able to mention them
together, not only as distinguished for their contributions
to the practical wisdom of their time, but as
evincing by the manner of their death their constancy
to a lofty ethical conception of the duties of life.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Empedocles is included in the same category as having
conferred great material and political benefits upon his
fellow-citizens, to whom he also addressed a poem
inculcating a pure and noble manner of life based on
the doctrine of Transmigration.</p>

<p>This brief review of the pre-Socratic and pre-Sophistic
Philosophers appears to indicate that, if their
ethical doctrines were not formulated with the scientific
detail and precision of later schools, their speculations
had a strongly ethical cast, and tended to work out
into practical morality in the sphere of daily conduct.
In spite of the numerous systems of Ethics which have
been propounded in ancient and modern days, a
scientific basis of Morality has not yet been truly laid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and it was, perhaps, a recognition of the difficulties
menacing attempts in this direction, aided by a feeling
that “moral progress has not to wait till an unimpeachable
system of Ethics has been elaborated,”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> which led
the early Greek Schools to confine their utterances on
Morals to “rugged maxims hewn from life,” which
compensated for their lack of scientific precision by the
inspiration they applied to the work of actual life.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that with the
Sophists the concerns of practical life began to assume
that predominant place in philosophical speculations
which they afterwards wholly usurped; and the claim
of the Sophists (whether or not Socrates is to be
reckoned among them) to be regarded as the founders
of Ethical Philosophy is not weakened by the fact that,
when Philosophy and Ethics were identified,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the term
Sophist was assigned to men whose lives were in
diametrical opposition to everything connoted by the
designation philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The Sophists of the Socratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
age, whose varied teachings were lacking in any
philosophical principle to give them unity and dignity,
brought the business of common life into so marked a
prominence, and recognized Conduct as so much larger
a fraction of life than it had hitherto been consciously
recognized, that the necessity of finding a scientific
basis for Conduct became apparent, and a sphere
was thus opened to the genius of Socrates, Plato and
Aristotle.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to linger in demonstrating the
important part played by Ethics from this point onward
in the development of Greek Philosophy. “I hold that
Socrates, as all are agreed, was the first whose voice
charmed away philosophy from the mysterious phenomena
over which Nature herself has cast a veil, and
with which all philosophers before his time busied
themselves, and brought it face to face with social life,
so as to investigate virtue and vice, and the general
distinction between Good and Evil, and led it to pronounce
its sentence that the heavenly bodies were
either far removed from the sphere of our knowledge,
or contributed nothing to right living, however much
the knowledge of them might be attained.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
this well-known passage from Cicero’s “Academics”
has been criticized for the too great emphasis which it
lays on the alienation of Socrates from Natural Philosophy,
and, moreover, as an attempt has been made to
show above, it lays in like manner too much stress
on the alienation of previous thinkers from Moral
Philosophy, or, at any rate, from empirical Ethics, it
expresses with great clearness the surpassing importance
which the common life of humanity, as illumined
by the light of virtuous ideals, was henceforward to
assume as the end and aim of philosophical investigations
and discussions. The overwhelming importance
of Ethics in the philosophical system of Plato is
directly or indirectly apparent in all his teaching;
and where he, too, indulges in physical speculations, it
is with the warning that probability is all that can be
expected from such investigations, and that they constitute
a wise and moderate recreation in the course of
severer and more legitimate studies.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But it must be
conceded that, while no writer has composed more
beautiful panegyrics in praise of Virtue; while no
teacher has depicted its surpassing importance to
humanity with greater devotion of spirit or subtler
charm of language; yet the severity of the intellectual
processes which alone lead to a comprehension of what,
in the Platonic system, Virtue is, has had the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
making Virtue herself appear almost “too bright and
good for human nature’s daily food;” too lofty and
afar for the common man to attain; a mere abstraction
to be preserved as a field appropriate to the gymnastics
of metaphysicians, and to be shielded from the harsh
contact of the common world and common men by the
<i>chevaux de frise</i> of dialectical subtlety. Excess of
Reason in Plato has produced a similar result to that
produced by excess of Emotion in modern Religion, and
it is not without Justice that a great writer of the
nineteenth century has described Plato as “putting
men off with stars instead of sense,” and as teaching
them to be anything but “practical men, honest men,
continent men, unambitious men, fearful to solicit a
trust, slow to accept, and resolute never to betray
one.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The accessibility of Virtue to the common
heart is conditioned in Plato’s system by its intelligibility
to the common reason. The dialectic processes
by which the Ideas of the Good, the True, the Beautiful
are pursued are merely repellent to the average man,
who does not care for Metaphysics, but wishes to be
good and pure and just in his dealings with his fellow-men.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
“Plato acknowledges that the morality of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
multitude must be utilitarian, since none other is
attainable save by the highly trained metaphysician.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Even when the multitude accept the teachings of the
philosopher, it is not because they are capable of the
knowledge of ideal truth, but because the philosopher
has compelled them to recognize, from utilitarian
reasons, that it is better to be virtuous than to be
vicious. But this acknowledgment of the inability of
the multitude to be virtuous in the highest sense, and
the assertion that they must submit themselves as clay
to be moulded by the philosopher, who alone has a
knowledge of ideal goodness, do not help in a world
where the philosophers are not autocrats, but where
every teacher must submit his claims to the intelligence
of the multitude. It may accordingly be
questioned whether Plato’s Ethics have furnished
inspiration for goodness except to those who have
already had a predilection for virtue as an appanage of
the highest intellect, or to those more general lovers of
the Beautiful whose taste is gratified by fascinating
descriptions of a quality which, in itself, has no special
charm for them, but which, when depicted by this
“master of the starry spheres” in its atmosphere of
cold but radiant splendour, has transfigured their moral
life with beams that do not “fade into the common
light of day.” Plato’s teaching, indeed, has something
monastic, exclusive, aristocratic in its import, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
“esoteric” doctrines which were taught in the grove
of Academus to students already prepared by a special
course of instruction to receive them stand at the very
opposite pole of Philosophy to those homely conversations
which Socrates would hold with the first chance
passer-by in the streets of a busy city. “Let no one
enter here who has not studied Mathematics” was a
phrase which summed up in a dogmatic canon of the
school the views of the master touching the exclusion
of the multitude from direct participation in Virtue
and Philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle brings us into a world where there is less
of poetry and beautiful imagery, but in which the
common man can see more clearly. If the landscapes
are not so lovely, the roadways are better laid and the
milestones are more legible. The contrast has been
often enough already elaborated. Its essence seems to
lie in the recognition by Aristotle that men are men,
and not ideal philosophers. It hardly needed those
famous passages in the “Ethics,” in which Aristotle
subjects the Theory of Ideas to a most searching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
criticism, to emphasize that predilection for the
practical concerns of daily life, as not only the proper
sphere of Ethics, but their foundation and material,
which is conspicuous in the general character of his
work. Over and over again he insists that happiness
depends upon action, not contemplation;<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and so convinced
is he that Ethics, like every other science, must
start from knowledge of actual facts, that he denies the
claim of those to be students of Moral Philosophy who
are inexperienced in the actions of life.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And it is,
surely, in allusion to the demand of the Platonic
Philosophy that the multitude shall permit themselves
to be moulded by the Platonist potter even into that
inferior form of virtue of which alone they are capable,
that Aristotle reverts to the famous saying of Hesiod
that he is second best only who “obeys one who speaks
well,” while assigning the moral supremacy to the man
who makes his own practical experience of life the
basis of his ethical theories and the mainspring of his
moral progress.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that Aristotle is the true successor
of Socrates, inasmuch as Philosophy, which under
the spells of Platonism had withdrawn again to the
empyrean, is charmed down once more by the Stageirite
to the business and bosoms of mankind. To use the
expressive metaphor of Aristotle himself, though not,
of course, in this connexion, if the creator of the “Republic”
shines as one of “the most beautiful and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
strongest” present at the Olympian Games, the author
of the “Ethics” is one of the “Combatants” who have
been crowned, because they have descended into the
arena, and by right action have secured what is noble
and good in life.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> After Aristotle, it was improbable
that Philosophy would ever again render itself obnoxious
to the reproach levelled against Plato by some
of his contemporaries that “they went to him expecting
to hear about the chief good, but he put them off with
a quantity of remarks about numbers and things they
could not understand.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Contemporary with the work of Aristotle and his
insistence upon the necessity that each individual man
should seek for the chief good in the sphere of his own
actual experience, occurred the relaxation of the dominant
claims of the State to the best part of the energies
and activities of the citizen. The change in the political
condition of Greece consequent upon the Macedonian
conquest had turned the Greek citizen back
upon his own soul for inspiration to guide his steps
aright. The philosophical tendency was thus aided by
external conditions, and the joint operation of both
these influences established in Stoicism and Epicureanism
the satisfaction of the moral requirements of
the individual man as the aim and end of Philosophy.</p>

<p>Whatever importance the leaders of the Stoics
attached to Logic and Physics—and different philosophers
formed different estimates of their value<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>—all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
were agreed that these parts of Philosophy were only
useful in so far as they enabled mankind to lead a
virtuous life; a life in harmony with nature and its
laws; a life which placed them above the domination
of “<i>Fear and hope and phantasy and awe, And wistful
yearning and unsated loves, That strain beyond the
limits of this life</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The Epicureans repudiated Dialectic,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and, as already stated, studied Physics with a
view only to freeing the mind of man from those supernatural
fears which hampered him in his attainment of
terrestrial virtue and happiness:—</p>

<p class="noindent">The investigation of nature with a view to eliminating
the fear of death as a factor in human conduct, clearly
enounced as it is in the poem of the Roman Epicurean,
is still more emphatically expressed in a “fundamental
maxim” of Epicurus himself: “If we did not allow
ourselves to be disturbed by suspicious fears of celestial
phenomena; if the terrors of death were never in our
minds; and if we would but courageously discuss the
limits of our nature as regards pain and desire: we should
then have no need to study Natural Philosophy.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The exclusion of Dialectics,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and the subordination
of Physics to Ethics, restricted—if, indeed, it were a
restriction—the scope of character and intelligence to
the sphere of conduct, and it is in the light of this
limitation that the full significance of the Epicurean
definition of Philosophy lies—“Philosophy is an active
principle which aims at securing Happiness by Reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and Discussion.” Here we have in practical completion
that identification of Philosophy with Ethics towards
which the whole tendency of Greek speculation had
been consciously or unconsciously working, and which
was fully consummated in the later development of
the Stoic and Epicurean systems. The combined effect
of this principle of Epicureanism, and of the contemporaneous
failure of political interest, was to direct
attention to those less ostentatious, but, for happiness,
more effective virtues, which flourish in private society
and in the daily intercourse of mankind. Because it
excluded Dialectics, and because it was excluded from
Politics, the gospel of the Garden established an ideal
of homely virtue which lay within the reach of the
average man, who, like Epicurus himself, was repelled
by Plato’s distance from life, and did not feel called
upon to cherish impracticable schemes of ameliorating
society under the dominion of a Demetrius the Liberator,
but was willing to content himself with a humbler
range of duty, with being temperate and chaste in his
habits, simple and healthy in his tastes, cheerful and
serene in his personal bearing, amiable and sympathetic
with his friends, and cultivating courteous relations in
those slightly more extended social circles where comity
and tact take the place of the more intimate and
familiar virtues of household life.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>By the method of placing in continuous order
certain common and well-known indications, we have
endeavoured to illustrate the view that the natural
development of Greek Philosophy led in the direction
of Ethics, and that the natural development of Ethics
led in the direction of a popular scheme of conduct,
which, fragmentary and incomplete as it might be in
a scientific sense, had yet the advantage that it was
founded upon the common daily life of the ordinary
man, and placed before the ordinary man in his common
daily life an ideal of virtue which, by efforts not beyond
his strength, he might realize and maintain. This type
of character, partly the growth of the circumstances of
the time, but strengthened and expanded by the manner
in which Epicureanism adapted itself to those circumstances,
reacted upon the sterner conception of the
Stoic ideal of private virtue, and when we reach the
revival of Religion and Philosophy in the Græco-Roman
world of the Empire, it is this ideal which is
the aim and end of every philosopher from Seneca to
Marcus Aurelius, from Plutarch to Apuleius, no matter
what the particular label they may attach to their doctrines
to indicate their formal adhesion to one of the
great classical schools.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> To take an extreme example<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
of a truth which will subsequently be illustrated
from Plutarch, Seneca, who is a Stoic of the Stoics, is
full of praise for the noble and humane simplicity of
the Epicurean ideal of life, and in those inspiring
letters through which he directs the conscience of his
friend Lucilius into the pure and pleasant ways of
truth and virtue, it is an exceptional occurrence for
him to conclude one of his moral lessons without
quoting in its support the authority of the Master of
the Garden. The absorbing interest of Plutarch as a
moral philosopher lies mainly in the fact that though,
as a polemical writer, he is an opponent, and not always
a fair or judicious opponent, both of the Porch and the
Garden,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> he collects from any quarter any kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
teaching which he hopes to find useful in inculcating
that ideal of conduct which he believes most likely to
work out into virtue and happiness; and though his
most revered teacher is Plato, the ideal of conduct
which he inculcates is one which Epicurus would have
wished his friend Metrodorus to appropriate and exemplify.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
This ideal Plutarch thought worth preservation;
it is the last intelligible and practicable ideal
presented to us by Paganism; and the attempts which
Plutarch made to preserve it are interesting as those
of a man who stood at a crisis in the world’s history,
and endeavoured to find, in the wisdom and strength
and splendour of the Past, a sanction for purity and
goodness, when a sanction for purity and goodness was
being mysteriously formed, in comparison with which
the wisdom and strength and splendour of the Past
were to be regarded but as weakness and darkness and
folly. The experiment was not without success for a
considerable time; and had Paganism been defended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
by Julian in the pliant form which Plutarch gave it,
and in the spirit of tolerance which he infused into
his defence of it, it is probable that the harmonious
co-operation, and perhaps the complete union, of the
classical tradition and the Christian faith would have
been the early and beneficial result.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> With a view to
observing some of the factors which contributed to the
success of Plutarch’s work, we propose to give a brief
glance at the ethical condition of the epoch in which it
was carried on.</p>

<p><i>Ethical aspect of Græco-Roman Society in the period of Plutarch:
difficulty of obtaining an impartial view of it—Revival of
moral earnestness concurrent with the establishment of the
Empire: the reforms of Augustus a formal expression of
actual tendencies—Evidences of this in philosophical and
general literature—The differences between various Schools
modified by the importance of the ethical end to which all their
efforts were directed—Endeavour made to base morality on
sanctions already consecrated by the philosophies and religious
traditions of the Past—Plutarch’s “Ethics” the result of such
an endeavour.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Few ages have left to posterity a character less easy
to define, or more subjected to the ravages of
mutually destructive schools of criticism, than that
which gave the Religion of Christ to the Western
world, and witnessed the moulding of Pagan Religion
and Philosophy—or rather of Pagan religions and
philosophies—into that systematized shape which they
afterwards presented against the progress of Christianity.
Many ancient and some modern apologists of Christianity
have appeared to think it essential to the honour and
glory of their Creed that the world, before its rise,
should be regarded as sunk in iniquity to such a depth
that nothing but a Divine Revelation could serve to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
elevate and purify it.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It has been maintained, on the
other hand, and that too by Christian writers, that no
epoch of Western civilization has been so marked, not
only by the material well-being of the mass of mankind,
but “by virtue in the highest places and by
moderation and sobriety in the ranks beneath,” as that
during which the new Creed was generally regarded as
a base and superstitious sort of Atheism.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It may be
conceded that the original authors of this period who
have been most read in modern times have easily been
construed into vigorous and effective testimony in support
of the former position. The poets and rhetoricians
of the Empire have had their most exaggerated phrases
turned into evidence against the morals of their own
days, and their less emphatic expressions have been
regarded as hinting at the perpetration of vices too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
monstrous to be more clearly indicated. If, by chance
an author has left writings marked by a lofty conception
of morality, and breathing the purest and most
disinterested love of virtue, this very fact has been
sufficient to justify a denial of their Pagan origin, and
the assertion that the true source of their inspiration
must have been Judæa. Hence the curious struggles
of many intelligent men to establish a personal connexion
between Paul and Seneca, and to demonstrate
that the Ethics of Plutarch are coloured by Christian
modes of thought.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Other authors of the period who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
furnish material for correcting this one-sided impression
have been less known to the multitude and less consulted
by the learned. Even were the worst true that
Juvenal, and Tacitus, and Martial, and Suetonius, and
Petronius have said about Roman courts and Roman
society; even were it not possible to supply a corrective
colouring to the picture from the pages of Seneca,
and Lucan, and Pliny, and Persius, and even Juvenal
himself: yet it should be easy to remember that, just
as the Palace of the Cæsars was not the City, so the
City was not the Empire. <i>Exeat aula qui volet esse pius</i>
is a maxim that could with advantage be applied to
the sphere of historical criticism as well as to that
of practical Ethics; and if we leave the factions and
scandals of the Court and the City under the worst of
the Emperors, and follow Dion into the huts of lonely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
herdsmen on the deserted hills of Eubœa, or linger with
Plutarch at some modest gathering of family friends in
Athens or the villages of Bœotia, we shall find innumerable
examples of that virtue which the Republican
poet sarcastically denies to the highest rulers. Even
after the long reign of Christianity, vice has been
centralized in the great capitals of civilization; and
Rome and Alexandria and Antioch are not without
their parallels among the cities of Modern Europe.
In Alexandria itself, the populace who could listen to
discourses like those of Dion must have been endowed
with a considerable capacity for virtue; the tone of the
orator, indeed, frequently reminds us of those modern
preachers who provoke an agreeable sensation of excitement
in the minds of their highly respectable audiences,
by depicting them as involved in such wickedness as
only the most daring of mankind would find courage
to perpetrate.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> We propose to deal elsewhere with the
testimony of Plutarch as to the moral character of the
age in which he lived, and at present confine our observations
to the assertion that his “Ethical” writings
are crowded with examples of the purest and most
genuine virtue; not such virtue as shows itself on
striking and public occasions only, but such also as
irradiates the daily life of the common people in their
homes and occupations. And although he is, perhaps,
in some of his precepts, a little in advance of the general
trend of his times, inculcating, in these instances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
virtues which, though not unpractised and unknown,
are still so far limited in their application that he
wishes to draw them from their shy seclusion in some
few better homes, and to establish them in the broad
and popular light of recognized customs;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> yet it is
clear to every one of the few students of his pages that
the virtues he depicts are the common aim of the
people he meets in the streets and houses of Chæronea,
and that the failings he corrects are the failings of the
good people who are not too good to have to struggle
against the temptations incident to humanity. The
indications conveyed by Plutarch and Dion respecting
the moral progress of obscure families and unknown
villagers point to the widespread existence through the
Empire of that same strenuous longing after goodness,
which had already received emphatic expression in the
writings of philosophers and poets whose activities had
been confined to Rome.</p>

<p>For there can be no doubt that the establishment
of the Empire had been accompanied by a strenuous
moral earnestness which is in marked contrast to the
flippant carelessness of the last days of the Republican
Era. The note of despair—despair none the less
because its external aspect was gay and <i>debonnaire</i>—so
frequently raised by Ovid and Propertius and Tibullus;
the reckless cry, <i>Interea, dum fata sinunt, jungamus
amores; Iam veniet tenebris Mors adoperta caput</i>, is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
last word of a dying epoch.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> These three great poets
utter the swan song of the moribund Republic. Their
beliefs are sceptical, or frankly materialistic; they shut
their eyes at the prospect of death to open them on
the nearer charms of the sensual life: devoting their
days and their genius to the pleasures of a passionately
voluptuous love of women. In their higher moods
they turn to the Past, but with an antiquarian interest
only, like Ovid and Propertius, or, like Tibullus, to
delight in the religious customs that still linger in the
rural parts of Italy, the relics of a simpler and devouter
time. If they turn their thoughts to the Afterworld at
all, it is to depict in glowing verses the conventional
charms of the classic Elysium, or to find occasion
for striking description in the fabled woes of Ixion
and Tantalus.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Even these descriptions change by a
natural gradation into an appeal for more passionate
devotion on the part of Corinna, or Delia, or Cynthia.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
If Propertius thinks of death, it is but to hope that
Cynthia will show her regard for his memory by visiting
his tomb in her old age; to regret, with infinite
pathos, the thousands of “dear dead women” who have
become the prey of the Infernal Deities—<i>sunt apud
infernos tot milia formosarum</i>; to lament that his
deserted mistress will call in vain upon his scattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
dust; or to postpone all consideration of such matters
until age shall have exhausted his capacity for more
passionate enjoyment. If he mentions the mighty
political events of his time, it is with the air of one
who watches a triumphal procession while resting his
head on his mistress’s shoulder.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> But these poets,
wrapped in all the physical pleasures which their age
had to supply, are not ignorant of the malady from
which it suffers; they know that their despair and their
materialism are born of the misery of long years of
sanguinary strife; and Tibullus, in one of the sweetest
of his Elegies, utters a wish which is the Ave of the
storm-tossed Republic to the approaching peace of the
Empire:—<i>At nobis, Pax alma, veni.</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><i>Cum domino Pax ista venit.</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Virgil and Horace are
poets of the Empire, and strike the dominant note of
the new epoch. It was not the mere courtly complaisance
of genius for its patrons that led Virgil and
Horace to identify their muse with the religious and
moral reforms of Augustus. It was rather a conscious
recognition of the spiritual needs of the new age which
led poets and statesmen alike to further this joint
work. It is the custom to regard the labours of
Augustus as resulting in the superimposition on the
social fabric of mere forms and rituals which would
have been appropriate were society only a fabric, but
which were utterly inadequate to serve as anything
better than a superficial ornament to an expanding and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
developing organism.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But, taken in conjunction with
the poems of Virgil and Horace, they show their real
character as outward and visible signs of an inward
and spiritual grace. It is true that Horace at times
attributes the disasters from which his countrymen
have suffered to their disregard of the ancient religious
ceremonies; to their neglect of the <i>templa ædesque
labentes deorum et fœda nigro simulacra fumo</i>;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> but
in the six famous Odes which stand at the head of
Book III he emphasizes the national necessity of
chastity, fidelity, mercy, loyalty to duty; and he utters
not less emphatic warnings against the general danger
from avarice, ambition, luxury. The essentially religious
character of the Æneid is evident to every
reader. That is no mere formalism which inspires with
moral vigour the splendid melodies of the Sixth Book.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Although the Poet uses the conventional machinery
of Elysium and Tartarus to emphasize the contrast
between Virtue and Vice by contrasting the fates that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
await them hereafter; yet justice, piety, patriotism,
chastity, self-devotion; fidelity to friend and wife and
client; filial and fraternal love: never received
advocacy more strenuous and sincere, never were
sanctioned by praise more eloquent, or reprehension
more terrible, than in those immortal verses which it is
an impertinence to praise. The question which presented
itself to Augustus, to his ministers and to his
poets, was how to re-invigorate and preserve those
qualities by her practice of which Rome had become
<i>pulcherrima rerum</i>. And we cannot wonder that an
important part of their answer to this question lay in
the direction of restoring those ancient religious ceremonies
and moral practices which had been most conspicuously
displayed when Rome was making her
noblest efforts to accomplish her great destiny. The
sanction of antiquity is the most permanent of all
appeals that are ever made to humanity; and, even in
times of revolution, its authority has been invoked by
those most eager to sweep away existing institutions.
<i>Pro magno teste vetustas creditur.</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But if Augustus and
his friends appealed to antiquity, it was not merely to
recall the shadows of the ancient forms and customs,
but to revivify them with the new life of virtue that
was welling up in their time, and which, in its turn,
received external grace and strength by its embodiment
in the ancestral forms.</p>

<p>The strong chord of moral earnestness struck by
Horace and Virgil grows more resonant as the new era<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
advances, until, in literature at least, it attains the
persistence of a dominant. Juvenal is so passionately
moral that he frequently renders himself liable to
Horace’s censure of those who worship virtue too
much; but, in his best moods, as in the famous lines
which close the Tenth Satire, he depicts the virtuous
man in a style which is not the less earnest and sincere
because it is also dignified and calm. Persius, whose
disposition was marked by maidenly modesty and
gentleness, and who is also described as <i>frugi et
pudicus</i>, shows, even when hampered by a disjointed
style which only allows him to utter his thought in
fragments, that devotion to the highest moral aims
which we should expect from a writer brought up under
the influences which he enjoyed;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and though he, too,
exhibits some of the savage ferocity of Juvenal in his
strictures of vice, he yet pays, in his Fifth Satire, that
tribute to virtue in the person of Cornutus which
“proves the goodness of the writer and the gracefulness
with which he could write.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Lucan, too, whose youth,
like that of Persius, had the inestimable advantage of
receiving a share of the wisdom which Cornutus had
gained by nights devoted to philosophic studies, exhibits
a spirit of the loftiest morality under the rhetorical
phrasing of his great Republican Epic.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Looking back,
with something of regret, to the days of a dominant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
oligarchy, he does not conceal the licentiousness which
society harboured beneath the sway of the later
Optimates, and he turns mostly to Cato as the type
which he would fain accept as representative of the
true Roman patrician:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The noble lines in which Cato refuses to consult the
Libyan oracle—<i>Non exploratum populis Ammona relinquens</i>—are
well known, and express a highly ethical
view of the divine administration of the world:—</p>

<p class="noindent">His biting sarcasms on those who exercise the art of
Magic are conceived in the same spirit of lofty reverence
for the Divine Nature,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and he would fain believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in the immortality of the soul as a stimulus to virtue
and self-abnegation in the present life.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The philosophers are marked by the same strenuous
seriousness as the poets. The letters of Seneca to
Lucilius are still an Enchiridion for those that love
virtue, and though there were, doubtless, in the ranks
of the philosophers some who deserved the ferocity
of Juvenal; some who laid themselves open to the
sarcasms of Seneca’s friend, Marcellinus;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> some like
Euxenus, an early teacher of Apollonius of Tyana,
“who did not care much to conform the actions of his
life” to the tenets of the philosophy he professed;<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
some who resembled the Cynics who haunted the streets
and temple gates of Alexandria, and did nothing, as
Dion said, “but teach fools to laugh at Philosophy;”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
yet it is beyond controversy that philosophers at this
time were generally recognized as the moral teachers
of society, and contributed largely, both as domestic
chaplains like Fronto, and evangelistic preachers like
Apollonius of Tyana, to the spread of that virtue whose
praise and admiration are so conspicuous and sincere
in the Greek and Roman writers of the period. The
contrast presented by the Sophists, with their artificial
graces and their luxurious lives, only served to emphasize
the worth of the true philosopher, and when a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Sophist turned round upon his career, and determined
to lead a virtuous life, he joined the ranks of those who
professed philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>One of the most frequently recurrent signs of the
essential love of virtue exhibited by this age is the
constant and strenuous insistence that practice must
conform to profession; and that hypocrisy is almost in
the condition of a cardinal vice. It may, of course, be
asserted that the passionate eagerness displayed touching
the importance of being true in act to the explicit
utterances of Philosophy is but a sign of conscious
weakness in well-doing; and that a truer virtue would
have given effect to itself without all this noisy preaching.
But a recognition of one’s own feebleness has
subsequently become one of the most lauded elements
of the saintly character, and it is given to very few to
blossom gently and naturally into that goodness which
does neither strive nor cry. Juvenal’s diatribes against
the Egnatii of Rome are not very different in language,
and hardly different at all in spirit, from the attacks of
New Testament writers on hypocritical members of the
Churches. So far as Greece was concerned, this love
of sincerity was but a return—from a somewhat distant
lapse—to the ideal of personal openness presented in
the famous words of Achilles:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">“For like hell mouth I loath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who holds not in his words and thoughts one indistinguished troth.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And not only is practice regarded as the culmination
of theory, the habit formed upon the active principle,
Philosophy, but the question of personal honour is
involved in the harmony between creed and deed; and
one mark of distinction between sophist and philosopher
is that the external apparatus of the former—“his
contracted brows and studied gravity of aspect”—do
not indicate the possession of the virtues which are the
pride of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch frequently lays strenuous weight on this
point;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Seneca, Dion, Aurelius, Epictetus, Apuleius,
are crowded with sermons on its importance.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> And if
pure professions are to be carried out into pure actions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
there is a growing sense that neither may impure
words be indulged in, even by those whose lives are
pure. Even so far as the composition of light verse
was concerned, a new sensitiveness was making itself
evident. Catullus had said in the old days that a
chaste and pious man might legitimately write verses
of a licentious character, and the catchword had been
repeated by all the society poets down to Martial.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
But, even when addressing Domitian, Martial, who
asserts that his life is pure, begs the Emperor to regard
his lightest epigrams with the toleration due to the
licence of a court jester. Pliny, the excellent and
respectable Pliny, could not read his naughty hendecasyllables
“merely to a few friends in my private
chamber” without subjecting his compositions to serious
criticisms in the homes of these friends, criticisms which
he strives to meet by a long display of great names
who have sinned in the same direction; but beneath
this display his uneasiness peeps forth at every
word.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The moral reformation officially inaugurated by
Augustus appears, in the light of these indications,
as corresponding to an increased tendency to virtue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
actually leavening Græco-Roman society. The formal
acts of the Cæsar, the policy of his ministers, the
religious sentiment of Horace and Virgil, the Stoic
fervour of Seneca and Lucan, the martyr spirit of the
Thraseas and the Arrias, the tyrannizing morality of
Juvenal, the kindly humanity of Pliny the Younger,
the missionary enthusiasm of Dion, the gentle persuasiveness
of Plutarch, are all common indications of
the good that still interfused the Roman world; all
point, as indeed, many other signs also point, to the
existence of a widespread belief that virtuous ideals
and virtuous actions were an inheritance of which
mankind ought not to allow itself to be easily deprived.
Philosophers and politicians, as they were at one in
recognizing the value of this heritage, so they were
also at one touching the general means by which its
precious elements were to be invigorated and maintained.
As we have already suggested, it is a remarkable
characteristic of the philosophic writers of this period—of
Seneca and Dion, of Plutarch, and even of Epictetus—that
there is in them no pedantic adhesion to the
fixed tenets of a particular school. The half-playful
boast of Horace at one end of the period—<i>nullius
addictus jurare in verba magistri</i><a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>—is reiterated with
something of sarcastic emphasis in Epictetus at the
other: “Virtue does not consist in having understood
Chrysippus.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Seneca gives expression to this prevalent
spirit of compromise with great courage and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
clearness. After quoting <i>suo more</i> a certain <i>nobilis sententia</i>
of Epicurus, he says: “You must not regard these
expressions as peculiar to Epicurus; they are common
property. The practice which obtains in the Senate
should, I think, be adopted in Philosophy. When a
speaker says something with which I partly agree, I
ask him to compromise, and then I go with him.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Anything in the whole gathered wealth of the Past
which promised support to a man in his efforts to
regulate his life in accordance with the dictates of
reason and virtue was welcomed and made available
for the uses of morality by the selective power of
Philosophy. Hence Plutarch levies contributions on
philosophers, poets, legislators; on Hellenic and Barbarian
Religions; on Mysteries, Oracles, private utterances;
on the whole complex civilization of the Græco-Roman
world, and the civilizations which it had absorbed
or dominated; on everything, in fact, which, from its
antiquity, or its possession of national or individual
authority, could be made available for establishing the
practice of virtue on the sanction of an ancient and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
inalienable foundation. The object of the following
pages is to scrutinize the results of this appeal to the
Past, as they are presented in the “Ethics” of Plutarch,
and to arrange in some kind of order the various
elements of which they are composed.</p>

</div>

<p>The question which meets us on the very threshold
of an inquiry into the religious views and moral
teachings of Plutarch is that involved in a definition of
his attitude towards the popular faith. His desire to
form a consistent body of doctrine out of its heterogeneous
and chaotic elements is not so intense as to
blind him to the difficulties of the task. Poets, legislators,
and philosophers have jointly contributed to the
formation of the “ancient and hereditary Faith,” and
Philosophy, Law, and Poetry, avoid reconciliation to as
great a degree as, in the days of Solon, the famous
Attic factions of the Paraloi, the Epakrioi, and the
Pedieis, to the pacification of whose internecine animosities
the policy of that statesman was directed.
The gods of the philosophers are like the Immortals of
Pindar:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Philosophy, too, rejects the Strifes, the Prayers, the
Terrors, and the Fears, which Homeric poesy elevates
to the divine rank.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Its teachings, moreover, are often
at variance with religious practices established or
recognized by Law and Prescription, as when Xenophanes
chid the Egyptians for lamenting Osiris as a
mortal, while yet worshipping him as a god. Poets
and legislators, in their turn, refuse to recognize the
metaphysical conceptions—“Ideas, Numbers, Unities,
Spirits”—which philosophers—Platonists, Pythagoreans,
and Stoics—have put in the place of Deity.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
This clashing of discordant elements in the mass of the
popular tradition is audible in Plutarch’s exposition of
his own views; a fact which is less to be wondered at
when we accept the hint furnished in the allusion to
Osiris just quoted, and note that Plutarch will not
confine his efforts, as “arbitrator between the three
Factions which dispute about the nature of the Gods,”
to the sphere of Græco-Roman Mythology.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But
although he will sit in turn at the feet of poets,
philosophers, and legislators, borrowing, from Science,
Custom, Tradition alike, any teaching which promises
ethical usefulness, he frequently insists, both in general
terms and in particular discussions on points of practical
morals, that Reason must be the final judge of what is
worthy of selection as the basis of moral action.
Philosophy, in his beautiful metaphor, so full of solemn
meaning to a Greek ear, must be our Mystagogue to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Theology: we must borrow Reason from Philosophy,
and take her as our guide to the mysteries of Religion,
reverently submitting every detail of creed or practice
to her authority.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> We shall then avoid the charge that
we take with our left hand what our teachers—our
legislative, mythological, philosophic instructors—have
offered with their right. The selecting and controlling
power of Reason, applied to philosophical discussions,
will enable us to attain to a becoming conception of
the nature of the Deity; applied to the matter of
Mythology, it will enable us to reject the narratives, at
once discreditable and impossible, which have become
current respecting the traditional gods; and, in the
sphere of Law and Custom, it will enable us correctly
to interpret the legal ordinances and established rules
connected with sacrifices and other religious celebrations.
The assumption which inspires all Plutarch’s
arguments on matters of Religion is that these three
sources supply a rational basis for belief and conduct:
but that superstition on the one hand, and atheistic
misrepresentation on the other, have done so much to
obscure the true principles of belief that Philosophy
must analyse the whole material over again, and
dissociate the rational and the pure from crude exaggerations
and unintelligent accretions.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> It must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
be admitted that he applies no definite rules of
criticism, constructs no scientifically exact system of
analysis, propounds no infallible dogmas. His canon
is the general taste and good sense of the educated
man; a canon which, vague as it may seem, is based
upon an intelligent knowledge of the practical needs
of life, and produces results which are applicable in a
remarkable degree to the satisfaction of such needs.
As provisional illustrations of Plutarch’s method in the
three spheres of Philosophy, Mythology, and National
Custom, we may note the discussion on the nature of
God in the “De Ε apud Delphos,” the criticism of the
great national poets of Greece in the “Quomodo adolescens
poetas audire debeat,” and the remarks in the
“De Iside et Osiride” concerning certain religious
practices in the worship of these two Egyptian deities.</p>

<p>In the first-named tract the ostensible subjects of
discussion are the nature and attributes of Apollo; but
it soon becomes quite clear that the argument is concerned
with the nature of Deity itself rather than with
the functions of the traditional god. “We constantly
hear theologians asserting and repeating in verse and
in prose that the nature of God is eternal and incorruptible,
but that this nature, by the operation of an
intelligent and inevitable law, effects certain changes
in its own form. At one time God reduces all nature
to uniformity by changing His substance to fire; and,
again, in a great variety of ways, under many forms,
enters into the phenomenal world.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> ... Philosophers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
in their desire to conceal these high matters from the
common herd, call God’s transmutation into fire by
two names—Apollo, to express His unity; Phœbus, to
describe His clear-shining purity. To denote God’s
suffering the change of His nature into air and
water and earth and stars, and the various species of
plants and animals, they figuratively tell of ‘tearings
asunder’ and ‘dismemberings,’ and in these aspects He
is variously called Dionysus, Zagræus, Nyktelius, and
Isodaites, and His ‘destructions’ and ‘disappearances,’
His ‘death’ and His ‘resurrection,’ are inventions,
enigmas, and myths, fittingly expressing, for the general
ear, the true nature of the changes in God’s essence in
the formation of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Plutarch here represents
himself as the speaker; and while Ammonius, who was
Plutarch’s master,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and is always spoken of by him
with the greatest reverence, is subsequently introduced
as taking a different view of the processes by which
God produced the world of phenomena, yet neither
does he depart from the rational standpoint in his view
of the terms under discussion.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In allusion to these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
terms, as explained by Plutarch from the Stoical view
of the Divine Nature,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> he says, “Surely God would be
a less dignified figure than the child in the poem,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
since the pastime which the child plays with mere
sand, building castles to throw them down again, God
would thus be ever playing with the universe. On the
contrary, God has mysteriously cemented the universe
together, overcoming that natural weakness in it which
tends perpetually to annihilation. It is the function of
some other god, or, rather, of some dæmon, appointed
to direct nature in the processes of generation and
destruction, to do and suffer these changes.” In both
these views the literal acceptation of the mythological
names is repudiated, and the two differ only in that
the Stoics quoted in Plutarch’s speech make the
Supreme Ruler modify His essence to the production
of phenomena, while Ammonius relegates that function
to a subordinate power; keeping his Platonic Demiurgus
pure from these undignified metamorphoses. It will
subsequently appear, when we come to deal with the
Dæmonology of Plutarch, that the latter view is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
one he also actually accepted. The discussion, at any
rate, furnishes a capital instance of what Plutarch
means by his assertion that Reason must be Mystagogue
to Theology. Mythological terms must be examined
by Reason before their meaning can be accepted
as an element in religious teaching. The particular
view taken of the expressions is left to the taste or
philosophic bent of the individual critic: to Academic
or Stoic reasonings; the only essential is that the crude
literal meaning of the terms shall be repudiated as discordant
with a rational estimate of the Divine Nature.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In the critical essay, “Quomodo adolescens poetas
audire debeat,” the same method is applied to the
whole religious and moral teaching of the national
poets. However great Plutarch’s admiration for Plato
as man and philosopher may be, his sound sense of
what is practicable in common life prevents him from
subjecting the ancient poetry of Greece, as an element
in ethical culture, to the impossible standard of the
“Republic,” and he therefore, on this question, opposes
Stoic and Peripatetic wisdom to the teaching of a
Master with whose sublime views he often finds himself
in agreement.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Throughout the whole work he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
applies the touchstone of common sense to all the
beauties and all the barbarities of the traditional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
legends as embodied in Epic and Tragic poetry.
Reason and common sense admit the high value of
imaginative literature in ethical education, and reason
and common sense decide what practical advice shall
be given to youthful students of fiction, in order that
moral lessons may be driven home, immoral incidents,
descriptions, and characters made harmless, or even
beneficial, while, at the same time, even purely æsthetic
considerations are not neglected.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the “De Iside et Osiride”
Plutarch deals fully with numerous examples of
religious practices coming under his third description
of the sources of religious belief, that, namely, of Law
or established Custom. He discusses their meaning in
the light of a principle which he states as follows:—“In
the religious institutions (connected with the
worship of Isis and Osiris) nothing has become established
which, however it may appear irrational,
mythical, superstitious, has not some moral or salutary
reason, or some ingenious historical or physical explanation.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
He is not always successful in his
search after a moral meaning, or even an ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
historical or physical explanation, in the customs
which he subjects to analysis. The rational attitude,
however, is unmistakable, and these introductory
remarks, personal as they may be to the priestess
Clea, and detached from the main body of the work,
yet stand in a true harmony with what we shall hereafter
see to be its essential purpose, to show, namely,
that while Philosophy can grasp the Highest without
the intervention of myth or institution, it can also aid
a pure conception of the Highest by studying the
myths and institutions which foreign peoples have
discovered and created as intermediaries betwixt themselves
and the Highest.</p>

<p>But in spite of the important part thus assigned
to Reason in settling disputed matters of faith, and
arbitrating on points of national and individual ethics,
Plutarch makes it clear that Piety and Patriotism have
claims in this matter which are actually enforced by
Reason in her selecting and purifying <i>rôle</i>. If he had
seen, as his age could not see, and as we can see, that
Reason can only be the Mystagogue to Religion in a
very limited degree, he would probably have been
patriot first and philosopher afterwards, or would,
perhaps, have accepted the compromise of Cotta,
and played each part in turn as public or private
necessities dictated. But the crux does not arise, and
Plutarch’s position never really has the inconsistency
which, carelessly considered, it appears to have, because
he is honestly convinced that what Reason rejects
in the national faith, it is good for the national faith
that it should be deprived of. Hence it is possible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
give examples of Plutarch’s views in this direction
without assuming that he forgot what prospect lay in
exactly the opposite direction. Hence he can quote
Ammonius as beautifully tender in his expressions
towards those who are bound up in the literal realisms
of the Hellenic faith. “Yet must we extend gratitude
and love to those who believe that Apollo and the Sun
are the same, because they attach their idea of God to
that which they most honour and desire of anything
they know. They now see the God as in a most
beautiful dream: let us awaken them and summon
them to take an upward flight, so that they may
behold his real vision and his essence, though still
they may revere his type, the Sun, and worship the
life-giving principle in that type; which, so far as
can be done by a perceptible object on behalf of an
invisible essence, by a transient image on behalf of
an eternal original, scatters with mysterious splendour
through the universe some radiance of the grace and
glory that abide in His presence.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Not only through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the dramatic medium of another personality, but also
when speaking his own thought directly, Plutarch
alludes with a sincere and touching sympathy to the
duties and practices of the ancient faith. The first
hint of consolation conveyed to his friend Apollonius
on the death of his son is given in words which
feelingly depict the youth as embodying the ancient
Hellenic ideals in his attitude towards the gods, and
his conduct towards his parents and friends.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The
converse of this attitude is indicated in many passages
where he deprecates a too inquisitive bearing in the
face of questions naturally involved in the doubt clouding
many ancient traditions of a religious character.
The great discussion on “The Cessation of the Oracles”
commences with a reproof directed at those who “would
test an ancient religious tradition like a painting, by
the touch” and in the “Amatorius” full play is allowed
to the exposition of a similar view, a view, indeed,
which dominates the whole of this fascinating dialogue.
Pemptides, one of the speakers, who rails lightly at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
love as a disease, is willing to learn what was in the
minds of those who first proclaimed that passion as a
god. He is answered by the most important speaker
in the conversation, a speaker whose name is not given
in the report, which is represented as furnished by
one of this speaker’s sons from their father’s account.
“Our father, addressing Pemptides by name, said, ‘You
are, in my opinion, commencing with great rashness to
discuss matters which ought not to be discussed at all,
when you ask a reason for every detail of our belief in
the gods. <i>Our ancient hereditary faith is sufficient, and
a better argument than this could not be discovered or
described.</i> But if this foundation and support of all
piety be shaken, and its stability and the honoured
beliefs that cling to it be disturbed, it will be undermined
and no one will regard it as secure. And if you
demand proofs about every one of the gods, laying a
profane hand on every temple, and bringing sophistical
smartness to bear on every shrine, nothing will be safe
from your peering eyes and prying fingers. What an
abyss of Atheism opens beneath us, if we resolve every
deity into a passion, a power, or a virtuous activity!’”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
This is, of course, an extreme conventional view, but
the fact, that it is put so fully, at least argues Plutarch’s
sympathy with it, though he would not, in his own
person, have pinned himself down to so unqualified an
expression of it. It will be noted that in this part of
the dialogue the gods only are under discussion, whereas
in regard to tradition on other elements in the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
faith the same speaker subsequently represents himself
as neither altogether a believer nor a disbeliever, and
he proceeds to search, in Plutarch’s own special way,
for “faint and dim emanations of truth dispersed about
among the mythologies of the Egyptians.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Plutarch’s
lofty idea of the passion of Love may have induced
him in this, as his strenuous moral aim did in so many
other instances, to emphasize for the moment any
particular aspect of the ancient faith which appeared
likely to furnish inspiration to the realization of noble
ethical ideals. He is anxious, at all events, that his
purely rational arguments shall not carry him too far,
as, on one occasion, after a long disquisition, the undoubted
purport of which is to refer oracular inspiration
to subterraneous fumes and exhalations, or, as one of
the speakers says, “to accident and natural means,”
Plutarch (“Lamprias” here is clearly a thin disguise
of Plutarch himself) is disturbed and confused that he
should be thought desirous of refuting any “true and
religious” opinions recognized with respect to the
Deity; and he forthwith proceeds to prove that it is
quite possible to investigate natural phenomena for
secondary causes, while recognizing a final cause in
the creative Deity.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Not only does Plutarch sympathize
with those who accept with pious simplicity the tenets
of the “ancient and hereditary Faith;” not only does he
deprecate too severe a handling of religious questions;
but he is also eager to support his view of a subject
by showing that it is not out of harmony with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
traditions or prescriptions of the national belief. Concluding
that consolatory letter to his wife upon the
death of their little daughter, which is the most
humane and natural expression of sympathy left us
by antiquity, he tries to show that those who die
young will earlier feel at home in the other world
than those whose long life on earth has habituated
their souls to a condition so different from that which
exists “beyond the gates of Hades,” and he says that
this is a truth which becomes clearer in the light of
the ancient and hereditary customs.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> No libations are
poured for the young that are dead. They have no
share in earth, nor in the things of earth. The laws
do not allow mourning for children of such tender
years, “<i>because they have gone to dwell in a better land,
and to share a diviner lot</i>.” And he adds, “I know
that these questions are involved in great uncertainty;
but since to disbelieve is more difficult than to believe,
in external matters let us act as the laws enjoin,
while within we become more chaste, and holy, and
undefiled.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> It must not be overlooked that Plutarch
was long a priest of the Delphian Apollo, and that the
duties of this position responded to some internal need
of his soul, and were not regarded by him as a merely
official dignity, is proved by the manner in which he
alludes to the subject. He is speaking on one occasion
of the many indications which the shrine gives of
resuming its former “wealth, and splendour, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
honour,” and he congratulates himself on the zealous
and useful part he has taken in aiding the work of
this revival.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> He mentions two friends as co-workers
in the sacred task, and appears also to felicitate a
certain Roman Governor of Achaia on similar grounds.
But he reverently proceeds to make it quite clear that
it is the god himself who is the ultimate cause of these
returning blessings. “But it is not possible that so
great a transformation should have taken place in so
short a time through human activity, unless the god
were present and continuing to inspire his oracle,” and
he concludes by censuring those who, in their inability
to discern the motive actuating the divine methods
with mankind, “depart condemning the god, instead of
blaming us or themselves, that they cannot, by reason,
discover the intention of the god.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch’s attitude of more than tolerance to the
“ancient and hereditary Faith,” an attitude which is,
of course, not inconsistent with his desire to place that
Faith on a rational basis, is partly explicable in the light
of his emphatic gratitude to the existing political constitution
of the Græco-Roman world. He would have
been an admirable co-worker with Mæcenas—πρόθυμος
καὶ χρήσιμος<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>—in carrying out the religious reforms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Augustus. He regarded the welfare of Society and
the State, of the family and the individual citizen, as
bound up with a belief in the gods whose agency was
so clearly visible in bringing the world to that state of
perfection which it now enjoyed, and which promised
to be eternal. No one now even dreamed of doubting
the identity of the gods of Rome with those of Greece,
and Plutarch carries the identification to the extent of
including the gods of almost every people constituting
the Roman Empire.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> These universal powers had the
world in their providential care, and Rome was the
divinely chosen instrument of their beneficent purposes.
The Emperor is the depository of the sacred
governing power of the world.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> When Tiberius shut
himself up in Capreæ, this divine potency never left
him. And though expressions of this kind may be
interpreted as a merely formal recognition of the official
dignity of the Head of the World, Plutarch’s many
eloquent descriptions of the blessings of the <i>Pax
Romana</i> leave us in no doubt respecting the character
of his views on this subject. “I welcome and approve,”
says Theon, “the present position of affairs, and the
subjects about which we now consult the oracle. For
there now reigns among us a great peace and calm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
War has ceased. Expulsions, seditions, tyrannies, are
no more, and many other diseases and disasters which
tormented Greece, and demanded powerful remedies,
are now healed. Hence the oracle is no longer consulted
on matters difficult, secret, and mysterious, but
on common questions of everyday life. Even the most
important oracles addressed to cities are concerned
with crops and herds, and matters affecting the public
health.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In the “Præcepta Gerendæ Reipublicæ” he
is still more outspoken in his praise of the Roman
administration, and in his recognition of the opportunities
which it gives for the culture of the individual
character within the limits of a greatly generous sway.
Plutarch, as is well known, was gifted with a patriotic
regard for the old achievements of the Hellenic name,
but he recognizes with so keen an insight the great
work being accomplished by Rome in the fostering of
municipal institutions, and the establishment of a
peace which meant the undisturbed happiness of
millions of obscure families,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> that, in the sphere of
practical politics, he deliberately turns away from the
group of inspiring ideas connected with ancient Hellenic
patriotism. He alludes coldly, perhaps even sneeringly,
to such of his contemporaries as fancied they
could apply the ancient traditions of glory to those late
and unseasonable times, like little children who would
try to wear their father’s sandals;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> counsels a complete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
submission to the duly appointed Roman authorities;
fully persuaded that within the limits of their
supremacy there is as much freedom as a reasonable
man could desire to enjoy; and honestly claims to find
scope, in a little Bœotian township, for such political
ambition as could be safely and wisely indulged.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It
is not difficult to sneer at the prudential limitation
of patriotism to such petty, insignificant, and meagre
efforts as the superintendence of bricks and mortar and
the carting of municipal rubbish; but the wiser thing
is to note that Plutarch’s opposition to vain fancies of
the revival of the ancient Hellenic splendour, except
perhaps in such a form as a Hadrian might be inclined
to revive it in an artificial Panhellenium, is based on
the conviction that happiness depends upon the free
development of individual character, the unrestricted
enjoyment of domestic peace, the undisturbed intercourse
of social life; and he knew that the Roman
sway made it possible, for Greeks at any rate, to enjoy
these blessings to a degree never previously known in
their chequered history.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> With a clear recognition of
the historical causes of the political decadence of Hellenism,
he regards civic discord as the evil which most
demands the attention of those who still seek opportunities
for public action, and he is particularly grateful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to the strong hand of Rome for controlling the internecine
animosities of Greek cities. “Consider,” says
he, “our position with regard to those blessings which
are counted as the greatest that a city can enjoy:
Peace, Freedom, Fertility of Soil, Increase of Population,
Domestic Concord. As regards Peace, our peoples
have no present need of politicians. Every Greek war,
every Barbarian war, has vanished from among us. For
Freedom, our peoples enjoy as much as their rulers
allow them, <i>and a greater share would perhaps not be
any better for them</i>. For fine seasons and plentiful
harvests, for families of ‘children like their sires,’ and
for gracious aid to the new-born child, the good man in
his prayers will invoke the gods on behalf of his fellow-citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
As for civic concord, that, he says, is in
our own power, and those who desire a life of political
activity could not do better than devote themselves to
the task of spreading harmony and friendship among
their fellow-citizens. The peace which the Romans
have established in the world makes it possible to
develop character on these social lines, and he recognizes,
in a pregnant comparison, that the freedom which
the Greeks enjoy is sufficient to allow the fullest play
to the development of their own moral character. The
drama is composed and staged: the prompter stands
behind the scene ready with the cue: but the player
can give his own interpretation of the character he
represents, though remembering that a slip <i>may</i> meet
with a worse fate than mere hissing in the audience.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Plutarch is clearly of opinion that this state of
things is best for his fellow-countrymen. He is as
firmly convinced of the divine mission of Rome as ever
was Virgil or any other patriotic Roman.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In his tract
“De Fortuna Romanorum,” he discusses the question
whether the greatness of Rome was due to Τύχη or
Ἀρετή, or, as he expresses the antithesis in another
place, to Τύχη or Πρόνοια—to Chance or to Providence,
we may translate, if we recognize that here Chance is
the divine element, and Providence the human.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In
other words, is the grandeur of Rome the result of
human virtue and forethought, or is it a direct gift of
the Deity to mankind? He decides in the latter sense,
though conceding much to the valour of individual
Romans; and his incidental expressions of opinion
bear as much evidence to the divinely inspired and
divinely guided character of Roman administration as
is borne by his definite conclusion. He says that,
whichever way the question is decided, it can only
redound to the glory of Rome to be the subject of a
discussion which has hitherto been confined to the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
natural phenomena of the universe—the earth, the sea,
the heavens, and the stars. His very words are curiously
reminiscent of Virgil’s <i>rerum pulcherrima, Roma</i>
(τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων ἔργων τὸ κάλλιστον),<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> as he tells how
Time, in concert with the Deity, laid the foundations of
Rome, harmonizing to that end the influence of Fortune
and Virtue alike, thus establishing for all the nations
of mankind a sacred hearth, a harbour and a resting-place,
“an anchorage from the wandering seas” of
human stress and turmoil, a principle of eternity amid
the evanescence and mutability of other things. He
describes with great vigour of language the instability
of the world under the domination of other Empires,
until Rome acquired her full strength and splendour,
and brought peace and security and permanence among
these warring elements.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Being so satisfied with the constitution of the world,
it is natural that Plutarch should have nothing but
reverent words for the eternal powers whose guidance
had led to so happy a disposition of human affairs.
However much Philosophy should endeavour to free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the mind from the crude and vulgar elements in the
“ancient and hereditary Faith,” she must never be
tempted to profess other than the most pious belief in
its fundamental truth and right; and the ultimate aim
of Philosophy must be to strengthen and revive the
ancient Religion by freeing it from inconsistencies and
crudities which, so long as they appeared to be an
essential part of the system, only existed to shock the
pious and to encourage atheism.</p>

<p>Plutarch’s attitude towards the ancient Faith may
thus be defined as one of patriotic acceptance modified
by philosophic criticism; not that criticism which tries
everything from the fixed standpoint of a set of rules
logically irrefutable: but that which is really the spirit
of rationalism pervading all philosophies alike. If
Plutarch’s attitude is that of a Platonist, it is that of
a Platonist whose experience of ordinary human affairs,
and whose recognition of their importance in Philosophy,
have compelled him to modify the genuine teaching of
the Master into something like the spirit of compromise
characterizing the later Academics. His teaching is
not the philosophic despotism of Plato; it might easily
be characterized as “plebeian,”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> as Epicureanism was
by Cicero, or “commonplace,” as Aristotle has been
described by Platonists. It breathes that free spirit of
truth which bids every man, whether he is a practised
philosopher or not, or even if he has not studied
mathematics, to give a reason for the faith that is in
him: to apply the touchstone of his own practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
experience and native intelligence to the domain of
Ethics and Religion as to the domain of every-day life,
because, as a matter of fact, the domain of every-day
life is the domain of Religion and Ethics. The dictum
of Hesiod, enforced by Aristotle and applied in practice
by the Epicureans, and by the Stoics, is the keynote of
the teaching of Plutarch:—“He is most excellent of
all, who judges of all things for himself.”</p>

</div>

<p>It will readily be understood that on no question
of Religion is Plutarch more willing to act as
“Arbitrator” than on that concerned with the Nature
and Attributes of the Deity. He knows and, as we
have seen, recognizes to the full the discordant nature
of the elements which, by force of circumstances, have
been driven into some kind of cohesion in the formation
of the popular belief, and it must be admitted that his
efforts to harmonize them into a rational consistency
are not completely successful. His own conception of
the Divine nature resembles the popular notion in
being a compound of philosophy, myth, and legalized
tradition. From Philosophy he accepts the Unity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
God; from popular Mythology he accepts certain names
of deities, and certain traditional expressions, which he
understands, however, in a sense quite different from
any interpretation current in the popular views, while,
at the same time, he never uses these names and expressions
without an air and attitude of the most pious
regard. The philosophical part of his teaching on the
nature of God is largely Greek, but by no means
entirely so, and neither is it the teaching of any particular
school of Greek philosophy. The Demiurgus of
the Timæus: the One and Absolute of the Pythagoreans:
the Πρῶτον κινοῦν, the νόησις, νοήσεως νόησις of
Aristotle; the material immanent World-Soul—the
λόγος ὁ ἐν τῇ ὕλῃ—of the Stoics:—one and all contribute
qualities to the Plutarchic Deity, and show how
irresistible the necessity for unity had become in the
spiritual, as in the political, world. The metaphysical
Deity thus created from these diverse elements is made
personal by the direct ethical relation into which He is
brought with mankind (as in the punishment of sin),
while the suggestion of personality is aided by the use
of the Greek popular names of the deities to describe
the attributes of the One Supreme God. Thus it has
already been noted that while Plutarch is ostensibly
discussing the attributes of Apollo he is actually
defining his position with reference to abstract Deity.
This ill-harmonizing combination of metaphysics and
popular belief is further placed in contact with views
originated by Oriental creeds, with Zoroastrianism,
with Manichæism, with “certain slight and obscure
hints of the truth, which are to be found scattered here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and there in Egyptian Mythology,”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> the whole presenting
a strange conglomeration, which appears to defy
any attempt to make a consistent theology of it, until
we see Plutarch’s method conspicuously emerging with
its twofold aim, of proving that all these different views
of God are merely different ways of striving after belief
in the same Supreme Power, and of inculcating a
sympathetic and liberal attitude of mind, which is far
more conducive to unity than a detailed agreement on
points of minor importance.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> This endeavour after
unity is supported by a strenuous and sincere belief in
what at first sight appears to be a principle of diversity—the
belief, namely, in Dæmons—but which Plutarch
uses to great effect in his attempts after unity, by
assigning, with Pythagoras,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> every recognized tradition
unworthy of the Highest to these subordinate beings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
whose influence is everywhere felt in nature and in
human life, and whose presence, at any rate, interpenetrates
and overruns the whole of Plutarch’s views
on religion.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>It is no unfitting circumstance in a priest of Apollo
that his noblest utterances respecting the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
God should be contained in discourses connected more
or less with the temples and traditions of the god. In
the discussion, for instance, on the syllable “E”
written over the narrow entrance of the Amphictyonic
Temple at Delphi, Ammonius is represented as expressing
views of the Divine Nature which are unsurpassed
for sublimity in any other part of Plutarch’s writings,
or even in Greek literature generally. We quote them
here as embodying Plutarch’s beliefs on the Unity,
Eternity, and Absoluteness of the Divine Nature.
“Not then a number, nor an arrangement, nor a conjunction
or any other part of speech, do I think the
inscription signifies. It is rather a complete and
concise form of address, an invocation of the God,
bringing the speaker with the very word, into a conscious
recognition of His power. The God salutes each
of us, as we approach His shrine, with the great text,
‘Know thyself,’ which is His way of saying χαῖρε to
us; and we in our turn, replying to the God, say εἶ—‘Thou
art,’ thus expressing our <i>belief in His true and
pure and incommunicable virtue of absolute being</i>.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>... Now
we must admit that God absolutely is; not that
he <i>is</i> with reference to any period of time, but with
reference to an immovable, immutable, timeless eternity,
before which there was nothing, after which there is
nothing, in respect to which there is neither future nor
past, than which there is nothing older or younger.
But being Unity, the Unity that he is <i>now</i> is the same
Unity with which he occupies eternity; and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
really exists but that which is endowed with the same
absolute existence as he—neither anything that has
come into existence, nor shall come into existence, nor
anything which had a beginning, or shall have an end.
In worshipping him, therefore, we ought assuredly to
salute and address him in a manner corresponding to
this view of him; as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the phrase already used
by some ancient philosophers, the phrase, ‘Thou art
one.’ For the Divine principle is not many, as we are,
each of us compacted of countless different passions, a
mingled and varying conglomerate of assembled atoms.
But Being must necessarily be Unity, and Unity must
be Being. It is Diversity—that is, the principle of
discrepancy from Unity—which issues to the production
of non-Being, whence the three names of the God
are one and all appropriate. He is <i>Apollo</i> (ἀ πολύς),
because he repudiates and excludes the many (τὰ
πολλὰ); <i>Ieius</i> (ἵος = εἶς) because he is Unity and
Solitude; and <i>Phœbus</i>, of course, was the name given
by the ancients to anything that was pure and unsullied....
Now Unity is pure and unsullied; defilement
comes by being mixed with other elements, as
Homer says that ivory dipped in purple dye ‘is defiled,’
and dyers say that colours mixed are colours ‘corrupted,’
the process being called ‘corruption.’ A pure and incorruptible
substance must therefore be one and whole.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>—“The
Inscription εἶ seems to me to be, as it were, at
once the antithesis and the completion of the inscription,
‘Know thyself.’ The one is addressed in reverence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and wonder to the God as eternally existent, the other
is a reminder to mortality of the frail nature that
encompasseth it.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere is the necessity which Plutarch feels for
believing in one supreme ruler of all the imaginable
universe more apparent than in a passage in which he
is seeking a regulating Intelligence for an admitted
plurality of worlds, to account for whose administration
a Greek of almost any period would have been constrained
to resort to the hypothesis of a plurality of
gods, supreme as each individual god might be in his
own individual world. The passage in question initiates
a discussion on this subject somewhat episodical to
the main argument of the “De Defectu Oraculorum.”
Plutarch himself is the speaker, though he represents
his interlocutors as addressing him by the name of
Lamprias.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> He is inclined to agree that there may be
more worlds than one, though repudiating an infinity
of worlds. “It is more consonant with reason to assert
that God has made more than one world. For He
is perfectly good, and deficient in no virtue whatsoever,
least of all in those virtues that are associated with
Justice and Friendship, which are the fairest of all
virtues, and those most appropriate to the divine
nature. And as God is not wanting in any respect,
so also He possesses no redundant or superfluous
characteristics. There must exist, therefore, other
gods and other worlds than ours, whose companionship
furnishes a sphere for the exercise of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
social virtues. For it is not upon Himself, nor upon
a part of Himself, but upon others, that He discharges
the claims of justice, kindliness, goodness. Hence it
is not probable that He is unneighboured and unfriended,
or that this world of ours floats alone in
the emptiness of infinite space.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Plutarch, however,
is merely on tentative ground here; the plurality of
worlds was an abstract academic question no less in
those days than in these. Admitting a plurality of
worlds, it does not necessarily follow that each should
be under the dominion of a separate Deity. “What
objection,” he asks, in answer to the Stoics, “what
objection is there to our asserting that all the worlds
are beneath the sway of the Fate and Providence of
Zeus, and that He bestows His superintendence and
direction among them all, implanting in them the
principles and seeds and ideas of all things that are
brought about therein? Surely it is no more impossible
that ten, or fifty, or a hundred worlds should
be animated by the same rule of Reason, or should be
administered in accordance with one and the same
principle of action, than that a public assembly, an
army, or a chorus, should obey the same co-ordinating
power. Nay, an arrangement of this kind is in special
harmony with the Divine Character.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Plutarch cannot
get away from his fixed belief in the absolute
Unity of God, and with God’s Unity, as we have
already seen, his Eternity and Immutability are involved.
But Plutarch re-asserts this truth in various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
places and forms. In the tract “De Stoicorum Repugnantiis,”
though chiefly dealing polemically with the
inconsistencies and self-contradictions of Chrysippus
and other early Stoics, he clearly exhibits his own
views in several passages. In one place<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> he asserts
that even those who deny the benevolence of God, as
the Jews and the Syrians, do not imagine him as
other than eternally and immutably existent, and
quotes with approval a sentence from Antipater of
Tarsus, to the effect that God is universally regarded
as uncreate and eternal. A little later in the development
of the argument<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> he adopts the Stoic position—which
Chrysippus is represented as contradicting—that
the idea of God includes the ideas of happiness,
blessedness, self-sufficiency, which qualities are elsewhere
shown to exist absolutely and independently
of all conceivable causes of opposition.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “They are
wrong who assert that the Divine Nature is eternal
because it avoids and repels anything that might tend
to its destruction. Immutability and Eternity must
necessarily exist in the very nature of the Blessed
One, requiring no exertion on his part to preserve and
defend them.”</p>

<p>The intermingling of the doctrines of various
philosophic sects is interestingly conspicuous throughout
these discussions on the nature of God; and not
less than elsewhere in the noble observations of the
Platonist Ammonius, which have been quoted from
the “De Ε apud Delphos.” It is equally interesting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
note that all the speakers in that dialogue, while
looking with their mind’s eye far beyond any individual
member of the Olympian Pantheon to that divine
power whose functions correspond with the essential
requirements of the loftiest monotheism, yet use the
name of Apollo as the professed nucleus of their
religious beliefs, and thus bring themselves into formal
harmony with the demands of the “ancient and
hereditary Faith.” The same tendency, at once orthodox
and unifying, is visible in the philosophic import
attached, in accordance with the Stoic practice, to the
popular names for the god in his various functions.
In other tracts and essays the same aim is conspicuous,
the same method of treatment is applied. In his
fascinating account of the Egyptian myth of Isis
and Osiris—which will be dealt with later from the
material which it furnishes for investigating Plutarch’s
attempts to identify foreign gods with the gods of
Greece—he uses both these divine names as a means
of approach to the Divine Nature, that One Eternal,
Absolute Being, which is the real object of the
philosopher’s clarified insight—πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μορφὴ
μία.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The true object of the service of Isis, for
example, is “the knowledge of that First and Supreme
Power which is compact of Intelligence; that Power
whom the goddess (Isis) bids her servants seek, since
He abides by her side and is united with her. The
very name of her temple expressly promises the knowledge
and the understanding of <i>Being</i>, inasmuch as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
is called the Ision (εἰς—ἰὼν), indicating that we shall
know <i>Being</i> if we <i>enter</i> with piety and intelligence into
the sacred rites of the goddess.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The passage just quoted shows the intimate connexion
between <i>Being</i> and <i>Intelligence</i>—the “Supreme
Power is compact of Intelligence;” and we are left in
little doubt respecting Plutarch’s views on this second
aspect of the Divine Nature. The conception of the
Deity as νοῦς, an ancient abstraction in Greek philosophy,
is at once strengthened and brought nearer to
the intelligence of humanity by Plutarch’s simple treatment
of it, and by his connecting it, wherever possible,
with the traditions of the popular creed. God is
not only Intelligence, but intelligent. “The Divine
Nature,” says he, “is not blessed in the possession
of silver and gold, nor mighty through the wielding
of thunders and thunderbolts, but in the enjoyment of
knowledge and understanding; and of all the things
that Homer has said concerning the gods, this is his
finest pronouncement:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">‘Yet both one goddess formed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one soil bred, but Jupiter precedence took in birth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And had more knowledge</i>’<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—a pronouncement in which he gives the palm for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
dignity and honour to the sovereignty of Jove, inasmuch
as he is older in knowledge and wisdom. And I am
of opinion that the blessedness of that eternal life
which belongs to God consists in the knowledge which
gives Him cognizance of all events; for take away
knowledge of things, and the understanding of them,
and immortality is no longer <i>life</i>, but mere <i>duration</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
The free, unfettered exercise of intelligence is therefore
a function of the Divine Nature; but although Plutarch
is clearly thinking of the νοῦς of Anaxagoras as embodied
by Plato in his conception of the Chief Good,
yet he succeeds in bringing the Divine Nature, by the
exercise of intelligence, into an intimate relation with
humanity which the Platonic Demiurgus never attains.
The true successors of Plato in the realm of Idealism
were the neo-Platonists, who maintained that “the sum
total of the Ideas exists in the Divine <i>nous</i>, not outside
of it, ‘like golden statues,’ which God must search and
look up to before He can think. It is not to be supposed
that He must needs run about in search of
notions, perhaps not finding them at all, perhaps not
recognizing them when found. This is the lot of man,
whose life is spent often in the search, sometimes in the
vain search, after truth. But to the Deity all knowledge
is always equally present.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The vicious weakness
of Platonism, whether Old or New, lies in the fact
that no real reason exists why God should ever leave
the contemplation of “worlds not realized” to create<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
this world after an eternally existing pattern, in the
intellectual contemplation of which he was already
happy.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The “absence of envy” is not a philosophic
reason: it is a Platonic leap over an unbridged chasm.
The aloofness of the Epicurean gods in their <i>sedes quietæ</i>
is the logical outcome of this aspect of Platonism.
Plutarch gives the Divine Intelligence an interest in
the beings He has created. Apollo (here again the
popular name is used for the Divine Being) knows all
the difficulties that trouble the public and private lives
of humanity, and he knows their solutions also. “In
private matters we inquire of Apollo as a seer, in
public matters we pray to him as a god. In the
philosophic nature of the soul he is the author and
inspirer of intellectual difficulties and problems, thus
creating therein that craving which has its satisfaction
in the discovery of Truth;”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> <i>e.g.</i>, “when the oracle
was given out <i>that the altar of Delos should be doubled</i>,
the god, as Plato says, not only conveyed a particular
command, but also indicated his desire that the Greeks
should study geometry; the task assigned involving an
operation of the most advanced geometrical character.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
In another place this paternal interest in the doings of
mankind is attributed to the Deity direct without the
intrusion of any traditional name for a particular god.
“It is not, as Hesiod supposes,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> the work of human
wisdom, but of God’s, to discriminate and distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
predilections and antipathies in character before they
become conspicuous to the world by breaking out into
gross evil-doing under the influence of the passions.
<i>For God is assuredly cognizant of the natural disposition
of every individual man</i>, being, by His nature, more
fitted to perceive soul than body: nor does He await
the outbreak of actual sin before He punishes violence,
profanity, obscenity.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Thus, although Plutarch accepts
the philosophic phrasing current respecting the nature
of the Deity, his ardent, sympathetic temperament
brings down the philosophers’ Deity from its majestic
isolation, and makes it “meet halfway” the gods of
the popular faith, so that both may be of service to
humanity, the latter being purified and elevated, the
other actualized and humanized. We discern with
sympathy Plutarch’s attempt to satisfy the eternal
craving of men for a mediator between themselves and
the unapproachableness of the Highest; and we are
prepared for his exposition of the doctrines of Dæmonology.
This tendency to give warmth and life to
philosophic abstractions is occasionally visible in an
unconscious attempt to assimilate the qualities possessed
by the Deity to those displayed in a less degree by
mankind. Thus, he implicitly accepts the Platonic
position that Eternity is all present to God,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> a position
which is also accepted by modern European Theology:
but he elsewhere regards the Deity (formally using
the name of Apollo) as a scientific observer, with infallibly
acute reasoning powers directed upon phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
retained in an unshakable memory. His predictions of
events are, therefore, really predictions, not statements
of present facts; and the “rigorous certainty and
universality” which they possess are the certainty and
universality attaching to the human discoveries of the
laws of geometry and the law of causation, and not to
a divine insight which is omniscience because it is
always regarding events as present, whether they are
actually past, present, or to come. “Apollo is a
prophet, and prophecy is the art of ascertaining the
future from the present or the past. Now nothing
exists without a cause, and prediction, therefore,
depends upon reason. The present springs inevitably
from the past, the future from the present. The one
follows naturally upon the other by a succession which
is unbroken from beginning to end, and, accordingly,
he who knows the natural causes of past, present, and
future events, and can connect their mutual relationships,
can predict the future, knowing, in the words of
Homer, ‘things that are now, things that shall be, and
things that are over.’ The whole art of Dialectics consists
in the knowledge of the Consequent.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Already in these passages, which represent philosophers
as discussing God in the terms familiar in
Greek philosophy, we can discern a gradual breaking
down of that metaphysical exclusiveness which had
hitherto marked the philosophic conception of the
Deity. We see God again becoming personal, and
reverting to that interest in the affairs of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
from which the philosophers, starting with Xenophanes,
had, in their revulsion from the anthropomorphic
realisms of the Epic traditions, excluded him. We
can already note that Plutarch believes in the “goodness”
of God in a sense quite distinct from the “absence
of envy” distinguishing the Platonic Creator, or even
from the sense involved in Plato’s admission that the
gods love the just, since one always loves that which
is made in one’s own image.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> We can see him going
further, indeed, than Aristotle, who compares the love
of men for the gods to the love of children for their
parents, a love which is based upon a recognition of
their goodness and superiority, and of their having been
the authors of the greatest benefits to humanity.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> But
we are not left without many explicit texts asserting
the goodness of God to mankind in emphatic phrases.
Plutarch agrees with those statesmen and philosophers
who assert that the majesty of the Divine Nature is
accompanied by goodness, magnanimity, graciousness
and benignity in its attitude towards mankind.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We
have already seen that Justice and Love are regarded
by Plutarch as the most beautiful of all virtues, and
those most in harmony with the Divine Nature,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and
many isolated sentences could be quoted to demonstrate
how firmly the belief in God’s goodness to man was
fixed in Plutarch’s mind. We are fortunate, however,
in possessing a special tract in which the personal
character of the Divine Goodness is so clearly exhibited
that a modern translator of the tract, writing from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
“Theological Institution,” is able to say, “I am not
aware, indeed, that even Christian writers who have
attempted to defend the same truth within the same
limits of natural theology, have been able to do anything
better than to reaffirm his position, and perhaps
amplify and illustrate his argument.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The tract referred
to is, of course, the famous production known as
the “De Sera Numinis Vindicta.” It is a bold and
beautiful attempt to reconcile the existence of an
actively benevolent Deity with the long-continued,
often permanent, impunity of wickedness in this world;
an endeavour to solve the question raised, especially
by Epicureans, but not unfraught with solicitude for
philosophers of other schools, respecting the patent
fact that human virtue and human vice have no natural
and necessary connexion with human happiness on
the one hand and human misery on the other. Christian
translators of the piece, from Amyot down to the
writers just quoted, have hailed it as an effective
vindication of the ways of God to man, and Comte
Joseph de Maistre, whose paraphrase is designed, as he
says, to please “ladies and foreigners,” is quite convinced
that such a justification could not possibly have
been written by one who was not a Christian.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Wyttenbach, whom de Maistre attacks for repudiating
this view, is willing, with all his scholarly caution, to
admit that Plutarch, in this tract, touches the excellences
of the Christian faith.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The position which Plutarch sets himself to overthrow
is that which is expressed most concisely in the
famous verses of Ennius:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ego deum genus esse semper dixi et dicam cœlitum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—a sentiment in exact harmony with the Epicurean
view of the matter.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> While, however, establishing the
providence and goodness of God as against the practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Atheism of the Epicureans, it will be seen that he is
equally temperate, and equally consistent with himself,
in avoiding the exaggerated zeal of those Stoics who, in
their eager desire to do something for the honour of
Providence, had subjected the minutest and commonest
actions of life to the jealous watching of an arbitrary
omniscience, so that, as Wyttenbach puts it, “that
most gracious name of Providence was exposed to
ridicule and contempt, being alternately regarded as
a <i>fortune-telling old crone</i>, and as <i>a dreadful spectre to
alarm and terrify mankind</i>.”</p>

<p>Let us see in what way Plutarch establishes the
providential benevolence of God without detracting
from his majesty.</p>

<p>A company of philosophic students, Plutarch himself;
Patrocleas, his son-in-law;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Timon, his brother;
and Olympichos, a friend;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> are found, at the opening of
the dialogue, regarding each other in silence beneath
a Portico of the Delphic Temple, in wonder at the
discourtesy of an Epicurean who has suddenly disappeared
from the party, after expounding the doctrines
of his school in the manner, doubtless, of Velleius in
the “De Natura Deorum,” though with a more limited
scope as expressed by the famous line of Ennius already
quoted. According to Plutarch, he had “gathered
together, from various sources, an undigested mass of
confused observations, and had then scattered them in
one contemptuous stream of spleen and anger upon
Providence.” The company, deprived of their legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
opportunity for reply, determined to discuss the question
of Providence as if the departed opponent were
still present, although it cannot be doubted that his
absence, and the consequent want of direct necessity
to “score off” him, lead to a more thorough and
impartial discussion of the topic. Patrocleas, at any
rate, states the difficulty with almost Epicurean boldness.
“The delay of the Deity in punishing the wicked
seems to me to be a strange and mysterious thing.
The wicked are so eager and active in their wickedness,
that they, least of all, ought to be the object of inactivity
on the part of God. Thucydides rightly said that the
advantage of delay was on the side of evil-doers.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Present immunity from the punishment due to crime
encourages the criminal, and depresses the innocent
sufferer. Bias knew that a certain reprobate of his
days would be punished, but feared that he would not
live to see it. Those whom Aristocrates betrayed at
the Battle of Taphrus were all dead when his treachery
was punished twenty years after. So with Lyciscus and
the Orchomenians.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> This delay encourages the wicked.
The fruit of injustice ripens early and is easily plucked,
but punishment matures long after the fruit of evil has
been enjoyed.” This demand of the natural man to
see their deserts meted out to the wicked is reinforced
in a more philosophical manner by Olympichos, who
maintains that delay in the punishment of sin deprives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
it of that salutary effect which its immediate infliction
would have upon the sinner, who regards it as
accidental, and not necessarily connected with his
crimes. The fault of a horse is corrected if bit and
lash be applied at once; but all the beating and
backing and shouting in the world at a later time
will only injure his physique without improving his
character. “So that I am quite unable to see what
good is done by those Mills of God<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which are said to
grind so late, since their delay brings justice to naught,
and thus deprives vice of its restraining fear.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, before replying to these weighty arguments,
preaches a short and eloquent sermon on the
text, “God moves in a mysterious way.” His thoughts
are not as our thoughts, nor His ways our ways. We
must imitate the philosophic caution of the Academy.
Men who never saw a battle may talk of military
affairs, or discuss music who never played a note;
“but it is a different thing for mere men like ourselves
to peer too closely into matters that concern Divine
Natures; just as if unskilled laymen were to try to
penetrate the intention of an artist, the meaning of a
physician’s treatment, the inner significance of a legal
enactment, by fanciful guesses and surmises.... It is
easier<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> for a mortal to make no definite assertion about
the gods, but just this—that <i>He</i><a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> knows best the proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
time to apply His treatment to wickedness. He can
truly discriminate in the character of the punishment
required by each offence.” These preliminary observations
are in the proper Academic style; they are
designed to indicate that the end of a discourse on
such intricate matters can only be the modification of
doubt by probability, not its settlement by absolute
logical certainty.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The assumption of the Platonic
attitude is appropriately followed by a Plutarchic
reading of the teaching of Plato, who is understood
as asserting that God, when he made Himself the
universal pattern for all beautiful and noble things,
granted human virtue to those who are able to follow
Him, in order that they might thus in somewise grow
like unto Him.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Further, as Plato says,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the universal
nature took on order and arrangement by assimilation
to and participation in the Idea and in the Virtue of
the Divine Nature. Again, according to Plato, Nature
gave us eyes that our soul might behold the order and
harmony of the heavenly bodies, and become harmonious
and ordered herself, free from flighty passions
and roving propensities.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Becoming like God in this
way, we shall emulate the mildness and forbearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
with which He treats the wicked; shall eradicate from
our minds the brutish passion for revenge; and shall
wait to inflict our punishments until long consideration
has excluded every possibility that we may repent after
the deed is done. The purport of this argument, and
of the examples which Plutarch, always rich in illustration,
furnishes in support of it, is clearer than the need
of attaching it to the Platonic scheme of creation.
Plutarch believes that “God is slow to anger”; because
gentleness and patience are part of His nature, and
because by speedy punishment, He would save a few,
but by delaying His justice He gives help and admonition
to many. God, moreover, knows how much virtue
He originally implanted in the heart of every man.
He knows the character and inclination of every guilty
soul; and His punishments are, therefore, different
from human penalties, in that the latter regard the
law of retaliation only, while the former are based on
a knowledge of character which does not quench the
smoking flax, but gives time and opportunity for a
repentant return to the path of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The world, too,
would have been deprived of many a virtuous character,
lost the advantage of many a noble deed, had prompt
punishment for early sins been inflicted. There is,
moreover, a soul of good in things evil; the careers of
great tyrants have been prolonged, and the world has
been the better for the movements which their tyranny
compelled. Evil is a “dispensation of Providence” in
Plutarch’s eyes, as in those of many modern Christians.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
“As the gall of the hyæna, and the rennet of the seal,
both disgusting animals in other respects, possess
qualities useful for medicinal purposes, so upon certain
peoples who need severe correction God inflicts the
implacable harshness of a tyrant or the intolerable
severity of a magistrate, and does not take away their
trouble and distress until they are purified of their
sins.” Sometimes, too, the Deity delays His vengeance
in order that it may take effect in a more strikingly
appropriate manner.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>But these external punishments are not the most
terrible that can be inflicted on the sinner. It would
be difficult, even in Christian literature, to find so
striking a tribute to the power of conscience in inflicting
its immaterial tortures on the criminal who has
escaped material recompense. Plutarch bases his observations
on this head on a repudiation of Plato’s statement<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
“that punishment is a state that follows upon
injustice,” asserting, as he finds in Hesiod, that the two
are contemporaneous and spring up from the same soil
and root; a view which he supports by many conspicuous
and terrible examples from history, the force
of which may be summarized in the fine and truthful
phrase—the antithetical effect of which would be destroyed
by translation—οὐδὲ γηράσαντες ἐκολάσθησαν<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
ἀλλ’ ἐγήρασαν κολαζόμενοι.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The conclusion which
Plutarch arrives at by considering this aspect of the
case is that “there is no necessity for any god, or any
man, to inflict punishment on evildoers, but it is sufficient
that their whole life is tormented and destroyed
by their sense of their impiety;” and that the time
cannot but come when the glamour and the tinselled
glory of successful crime will be torn away, and nothing
shall remain but the base and dreadful memory to
torture awakening conscience with the pangs of an
unquenchable remorse.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>A fresh perplexity as to the goodness and justice of
God is here raised by Timon, who cannot see that it is
in harmony with these divine qualities that the sins of
the fathers should, as Euripides complained, be visited
upon the children.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The punishment of the innocent
is no compensation for the escape of the guilty. God,
in this case, would be like Agathocles, the tyrant of
Syracuse, who ravaged Corcyra because the Homeric
Corcyreans had given a welcome to Odysseus, and
retorted the blinding of the mythical Cyclops upon the
Ithacensians when they complained that his soldiers
had looted their sheepfolds. “Where, indeed,” asks
Timon, “is the reason and justice of this?”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Plutarch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
can only reply that, if the descendants of Hercules and
Pindar are held in honour on account of the deeds of
their progenitors, there is nothing illogical in the
descendants of a wicked stock being punished. But
he knows that he is on difficult ground, and repeats
the Academic caution against too much dogmatism in
these intricate matters. He falls back upon natural
causes here, as if seeking to exonerate the Deity from
direct responsibility for a striking injustice. An
hereditary tendency to physical disease is possible, and
may be transmitted from ancestors who lived far back
in antiquity. Why should we marvel more at a cause
operating through a long interval of time, than through
a long interval of space? If Pericles died, and Thucydides
fell sick, of a plague that originated in Arabia,
why is it strange that the Delphians and Sybarites
should be punished for the offences of their ancestors?<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Moreover, a city is a continuous entity with an abiding
personality; just as child, and boy, and man are not
different persons, but are unified by the consciousness
of identity;—nay, less marked changes take place in a
city than in an individual. A man would know Athens
again after thirty years of absence, but a far shorter
period serves to obliterate the likenesses of our personal
acquaintance. A city rejoices in the glory and splendour
of its ancient days; it must also bear the burden of its
ancient ignominies. And if a city has this enduring
personality which makes it a responsible agent throughout
its existence, the members of the same family are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
much more intimately connected. There would, therefore,
have been less injustice inflicted had the posterity
of Dionysius been punished by the Syracusans than
was perpetrated by their ejection of his dead body
from their territories. For the soul of Dionysius had
left his body, but the sons of wicked fathers are
often dominated by a good deal of their parents’
spirit.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>We are conscious of some artificial straining of the
argument in this place, and shortly perceive that the
mention of the soul of Dionysius is intended to prepare
the way for a discussion on the immortality of the soul.
Plutarch cannot believe that the gods would show so
much protective care for man—would give so many
oracles, enjoin so many sacrifices and honours for the
dead—if they knew that the souls of the dead perished
straightway, leaving the body like a wreath of mist or
smoke, as the Epicureans believed.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He shrinks from
the thought that the Deity would take so much account
of us, if our souls were as brief in their bloom as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
forced and delicate plants that women grow in their
fragile flower-pots, their short-lived Gardens of Adonis.
He is convinced that the belief in the after-existence of
the soul stands or falls with the belief in the Providence
of God.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> If there is a Providence, there is existence
after death; and if there is existence after death, then
there is stronger reason for supposing that every soul
receives its due reward or punishment for its life on
Earth. But here Plutarch, after just touching one of
the cardinal principles of Christian teaching, the dogma
of Heaven and Hell, starts away from the consequence
which almost seems inevitable, and which Christianity
accepted to the full—the belief that our life here should
be modelled in relation to the joys and penalties that
await us in the other world. He clearly believed that
their ethical effect upon life is small.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The rewards
and punishments of the soul hereafter are nothing to
us here. Perhaps we do not believe them, and in any
case we cannot be certain that they will come. This
is the position at which Plutarch arrives in the course
of rational argument, and he at once returns to the
sphere of our present life to find surer sanctions for
goodness. Such punishments as are inflicted in this
world on the descendants of an evil race are conspicuous
to all that come hereafter, and deter many from wickedness.
Besides, God does not punish indiscriminately.
He has a watchful care even over the children of those
who have been notorious for evildoing, and instead of
delaying the punishment in their case, early checks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
their hereditary disposition to vice by appropriate
restraints born of His intimate knowledge of the
character and inclination of the human heart. But
if, in spite of this, a man persists in the sinful
courses of his ancestors, it is right that he should
inherit their punishment as he has inherited their
crimes.</p>

<p>The dialogue concludes with a myth of the type of
Er the Armenian, in which, after the manner of Plato,
Plutarch embodies views on the state of the soul after
death, for which no place could be found in the rational
argumentation of mere prose. Thespesius of Soli, an
abandoned profligate, has an accident which plunges
him into unconsciousness for three days. In this
period his soul visits the interstellar spaces, where the
souls of the dead are borne along in various motion;
some wailing and terror-struck; others joyous and
delighted; some like the full moon for brightness;
others with faint blemishes or black spots like snakes.
Here, in the highest place, was Adrastea, the daughter
of Zeus and Ananke, from whom no criminal could
hope ever to escape. Three kinds of justice are her
instruments. Poena is swift to punish, chastising those
whose sin can be expiated while they are still on earth.
Those whose wickedness demands severer penalties are
reserved for Justice in the afterworld. The third class
of sinners, the irretrievably bad, are cast by Justice
into the hands of Erinnys, “the third and most terrible
of the servants of Adrastea,” who pursues them as they
wander hither and thither in reckless flight, and finally
thrusts them all with pitiless severity into a place of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
unspeakable darkness.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In these acts of immortal
justice the soul is bared utterly, and her sins and crimes
are relentlessly exposed. All this is explained to
Thespesius by a kinsman who recognizes him. He is
then shown various wonders of the afterworld: the
place of Oblivion, a deep chasm by which Dionysus
and Semele had ascended into heaven, above which
the souls hovered in rapture and mirth, caused by the
fragrance of the odours which were breathed by a soft
and gentle air that issued from the “pleasing verdure
of various herbs and plants” which adorned the sides
of this wonderful chasm. He sees the light of the
Tripod of the Delphic oracle, or would have seen it
had he not been dazzled with the excess of its brightness;
and hears the voice of the Pythia uttering various
oracles. Then follow Dantesque scenes of the punishments
allotted to various kinds of wickedness, among
which it is interesting to note that hypocrisy is tortured
with greater severity than open vice. A lake of boiling
gold, a lake of frozen lead, a lake of iron, with attendant
Dæmons to perform the usual functions, are
allotted to the punishment of avarice.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> But the most
terrible fate is that of those whose punishment never
ends, who are constantly retaken into the hands of
Justice; and these, it is important to note, in the light
of the argument which preceded the story, are those
whose posterity have been punished for their transgressions.
We can see how little Plutarch is satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
with his own reasonings on this point; they are, as
Wyttenbach says, <i>acutius quam verius dicta</i>: the punishment
of the children for the sins of the fathers clearly
leaves the advantage, so far as concerns this world, on
the side of the transgressors. Plutarch, with his firmly
pious belief in the justice and goodness of God, feels
driven to assert that the balance must be redressed
somewhere, and he invokes the aid of Myth to carry
him, in this case, whither Reason refuses to go; and
taking the myth as a whole, and in relation to the
tract in which it is embodied, we cannot doubt that
its object is to enforce that doctrine of rewards and
punishments in the Hereafter, from which Plutarch,
as we have seen, shrinks when an occasion arises for
pressing it from the standpoint of Reason. The punishments
which Thespesius has witnessed in his visit to
the Afterworld have the effect of turning him into a
righteous man in this world, and Plutarch clearly hopes
that the story will likewise convince those who are not
convinced by his reasons. We may gather, however,
that inclined as he was to believe that the providence
of God extended into the Afterworld, his attitude, as
fixed by reason and probability, is summed up in the
words already referred to—“Such rewards or punishments
as the soul receives for the actions of its previous
career are nothing to us who are yet alive, being disregarded
or disbelieved.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But whatever may be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
condition of the soul after death, and its relation to the
Deity in that condition, Plutarch has made it quite
certain that he believes in the goodness of God as safeguarding
the interests of humanity in this world. It
is clear in every part of this interesting dialogue that
the God whom Plutarch believes in is a personal deity,
a deity full of tender care for mankind, supreme, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
by virtue of his omnipotence and justice, but supreme
also by virtue of his infinite patience and mercy.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p><i>Plutarch’s Dæmonology—Dæmonology as a means of reconciliation
between the traditional Polytheism and philosophic Monotheism—Dæmonlore
in Greek philosophers and in the popular faith—Growth
of a natural tendency to identify the gods of the
polytheistic tradition with the Dæmons—Emphasis thus given
to the philosophic conception of the Deity—Dæmons responsible
for all the crude and cruel superstitions attaching to the
popular gods—Function of the Dæmons as mediators between
God and man.</i></p>

</div>

<p>How, then, does Plutarch reconcile this lofty conception
of a Deity who is Unity, Eternity, and
Supreme Intelligence, with the multitude of individual
deities which form so essential a part of the “hereditary
Faith” of Græco-Roman civilization, and which are
universally admitted as displaying qualities discrepant
from even a far lower notion of God than that which
Plutarch actually maintained? Further, since the
Empire includes other nationalities than the Greeks,
and the Roman Pantheon is not the exclusive habitation
of native-born deities, how shall he find a place in
his theological scheme for the gods of other peoples,
so that there may be that Catholic Unity in faith
which shall correspond to the one political dominion
under which the world dwells in so great a peace and
concord?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The difficulty of reconciling Polytheism with philosophic
Monotheism was, of course, not new. In earlier
days it had been necessary for philosophers to secure
their monotheistic speculations from the charge of
Atheism by finding in their systems a dignified position
for the popular gods. And even those philosophers
who sincerely believed in the existence of beings corresponding
to the popular conceptions felt the need of
accounting, in some more or less specious way, for the
ill deeds that were traditionally attributed to so many
of them. The ancient doctrine of Dæmons, emanating
from some obscure source in Antiquity,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
adopted by the Pythagoreans in the latter sense,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> while
Plato, who believed in none of these things, had, on
one or two occasions, by the use of philosophic “myth”
replete with more than Socratic irony, described these
beings as playing a part between God and man which
might be tolerantly regarded as not greatly dissimilar
from that popularly assigned to the lesser deities of
the Hellenic Olympus.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In the “Statesman,” the
creation-myth, to which the Stranger invites the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
younger Socrates to give his entire attention, “like a
child to a story,” describes how the Deity himself
tended men and was their protector, while Dæmons
had a share, after the manner of shepherds, in the
superintendence of animals according to genera and
herds.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Another story which Socrates, in the “Banquet,”
says that he heard from Diotima, that wonderful
person who postponed the Athenian plague for ten
years, tells how Eros is a great Dæmon; how Dæmons
are intermediate between gods and mortals; how the
race of Dæmons interpret and transmit to the gods
the prayers and sacrifices of men, and interpret and
transmit to men the answers and commands of the
gods.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> For God, we are told, is not directly associated
with man; but it is through the mediation of the
Dæmons, who are many and various, that all communion
and converse take place between the human
and the Divine.</p>

<p>But apart altogether from the philosophic use of
Dæmonology, there are evidences that the belief in
Dæmons was held in some sort of loose combination
with the popular polytheistic faith. The Hesiodic
poems were a compendium of early Hellenic theology,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
and Hesiod, according to Plutarch himself, was the
first to indicate with clearness and distinctness the
existence of four species of rational beings—gods,
<i>dæmons</i>, heroes, and men.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> In the passage of Hesiod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
referred to (<i>Works and Days</i>, 109 sqq.) two kinds of
Dæmons are described. The dwellers in the Golden
Age are transformed, after their sleep-like death on
earth, into Terrestrial Dæmons:—</p>

immortal guardians over mortal men.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
The races of the Silver Age become Subterranean
powers, blessed beings, but inferior in honour to the
former class, and distinctly described as mortal.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Hesiod says nothing about Evil Dæmons, although the
disappearance of the Brazen Race furnished an opportunity
for their introduction into his scheme of supernatural
beings. But once the existence of beings
inferior to the gods in the celestial hierarchy obtained
a recognition in popular tradition, however vague the
recognition might be, the conception would tend to
gather strength and definiteness from the necessity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
first expressed by the philosophers, but doubtless widely
spread among the people, of safeguarding the sanctity
of the gods, while at the same time recognizing the
substantial validity of tradition. This tendency would
be also probably aided by the fact that in Homer,
as Plutarch points out, and in the dramatists and
prose writers generally, as is well known, the designations
of “gods” and “dæmons” were mutually
interchanged.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Plutarch, at all events, who boldly
uses the Dæmons to perform such functions, and to bear
the blame for such actions, as were inappropriate to
the divine character, is enabled to make one of his
<i>dramatis personæ</i>—Cleombrotus, the traveller, who was
specially devoted to the study of such matters—assert
that “it can be demonstrated by unexceptionable
testimony from antiquity that there do exist beings
of a nature intermediate between that of God and man,
beings subject to mortal passions and liable to inevitable
changes, but whom we must, <i>in accordance
with the established custom of our fathers</i>, regard and
invoke as Dæmons, giving them all due reverence.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
It is natural, therefore, in the light of these indications,
to believe that, side by side with the popular gods,
there existed, in the popular imagination, subordinate
beings of two kinds, both described as Dæmons: the
first class comprising the good and benevolent Dæmons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of Hesiod, the second including Dæmons of an evil
character and disposition, the belief in which had
developed naturally out of the Hesiodic conception,
from the necessity of fixing the responsibility of evil
deeds on supernatural beings different in nature from
the purity and goodness of Deity.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Such a classification
of supernatural beings—gods, Dæmons, and evil
Dæmons—could not, of course, be rigidly maintained;
the more the good Dæmons were discriminated from
their evil brethren, the more they would tend to
become identified with the gods of the popular tradition,
and the line of demarcation between the divine and the
dæmonic nature would be broken down,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Dæmons and
gods would be identified, and the splendour and purity
of the Supreme God of all would shine out more fully
when contrasted with those other gods, who, after all,
were only Dæmons. Such, at least, is the process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
which appears to be taking place in the numerous
contributions which Plutarch makes to the subject of
Dæmonology. He is evidently a sincere believer in
the existence of Dæmons, not a believer in the
Platonic sense, and not a believer merely because he
wishes to come to terms with popular ideas. But the
final result, so it appears to us, is that the popular gods
become identified with Dæmons, and are prepared,
even in Pagan times, to take that position which was
assigned to them with such whole-hearted sincerity by
the early Christian Fathers;<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> to become the fiends and
devils and sprites of another dispensation; to aid
Saladin in excluding the Crusaders from the Holy
Land; to “drink beer instead of nectar” as day
labourers in German forests; or to shine with a sinister
splendour on the lives of monks and peasants in the
rural districts of France.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch gives emphatic indications of his own
attitude on the subject by drawing attention to such
expressions of the earlier philosophers as pointed to the
recognition of two opposite descriptions of Dæmons—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
virtuous and the vicious. In one place, as we have
seen, he admits that Homer does not distinguish
between the terms “Gods” and “Dæmons,” and in his
historical <i>résumé</i> of Dæmonology in the “Isis and
Osiris,”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> he is compelled to make a parallel admission
that the Homeric epithet derived from Dæmons is
indiscriminately applied to good and bad actions. He
makes this admission, however, the basis of a subtle
conclusion to the effect that Homer wished to imply
that the Dæmons had a confused and ill-defined
character, involving the existence of both good and bad
specimens of the race. Nothing definitely distinguishing
between the two sorts of Dæmons is to be obtained
from Plato,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and Plutarch accordingly dwells with
special emphasis upon the views of Empedocles and
Xenocrates, who maintained, the one, that Dæmons
who had been guilty of sins of commission or omission
were driven about between earth and sky and sea and
sun, until this purifying chastisement restored them to
their natural position in the dæmonic hierarchy;<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
other, that certain disgraceful and ill-omened sacrificial
observances “are not properly connected with the
worship of the <i>gods or of good Dæmons</i>,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> but that there
are surrounding us certain beings, great and potent,
but malignant too, and hateful, who rejoice in such
repulsive ceremonies, and are thereby restrained from
the perpetration of greater evils.” Democritus and
Chrysippus are elsewhere quoted as supporters of the
same view.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, accordingly, faithful to his principle of
making Philosophy Mystagogue to Religion, has
obtained from the philosophers a conviction that there
are two kinds of dæmonic beings, two sets of supernatural
characters with attributes inferior to those of
the Divine Nature, and yet superior to those displayed
by the human family. It has already been shown
how naturally the good Dæmons would tend to
become identified with the gods: a passage has just
been quoted in which we can see this process of identification
taking place. But Plutarch furnishes still
more emphatic testimony to the necessity of such a
consummation.</p>

<p>The group of philosophers gathered together at
Delphi to discuss the cessation of the oracles have fallen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
into an argument on the nature of Dæmons, and certain
considerations have been introduced which indicate a
liability to vice and death as inherent in their nature.
This conclusion shocks one of the speakers, but the
pious Cleombrotus wants to know in what respect
Dæmons will differ from gods if they are endowed with
immortality and immunity from sin.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> It is most significant,
however, that the famous and beautiful story
which Cleombrotus tells in support of his belief in the
mortality of Dæmons, the story of the death of “the
great Pan,” is actually concerned with an announcement
of the death of one whom the popular faith
accepted as a deity.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Demetrius, who had just come
from Britain, near which were many scattered desert
islands, some of them named after Dæmons and heroes,
gives an authentic account of the death of a Dæmon in
the island of Anglesea.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Cleombrotus then shows how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
a belief in the nativity and mortality of the Dæmons is
not unknown in Greek philosophy, “for the Stoics,”
says he, “maintain this view, <i>not only with regard to
the Dæmons but also with regard to the gods</i>—holding
one for the Eternal and Immutable, while regarding
the remainder to have been born, and to be subject to
death.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The whole course of the argument, even
though the speakers are represented as unconscious of
the fact, leads to the identification of the popular deities
with the Dæmons. This strain of thought elsewhere
loses the unconscious quality, and becomes as definitely
dogmatic as Plutarch’s Academic bent of mind would
allow. In the “Isis and Osiris,” for example, he argues
for the probability of the view which assigns the
legends of these two deities not to gods or men, but to
Dæmons;<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and proceeds still further to breach the
partition wall between the two natures by introducing
into his Dæmonology such legends as have raised Osiris
and Isis, on account of their virtue, from the rank of
good Dæmons to that of the gods,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and describes them
as receiving everywhere the combined honours of gods
and Dæmons; and he appropriates the argument to
Greek religion by comparing this promotion to those
of Herakles and Dionysus; by identifying Isis with
Proserpine, and subsequently Osiris with Dionysus.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>But whatever may have been the views explicitly
maintained by Plutarch in this connexion, it is his
constant practice to shift on to the shoulders of the
Dæmons the responsibility for all those legends,
ceremonies, and practices, which, however appropriate
and necessary parts of the national faith they may be,
are yet inconsistent with the qualities rightly attributable
to Deity.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> We have already noticed his unwillingness
to impugn the immutability of the Creator
by regarding His essence as capable of metamorphosis
into the phenomena of the created world.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> “It is,”
says Ammonius, “the function of some other god to do
and suffer these changes—or, rather, of some Dæmon
appointed to direct Nature in the processes of generation
and destruction.” This relationship of the Dæmons to
the supreme power as conceived by philosophy is more
completely stated in the short tract, “De Fato,”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> where
we are told that (1) there is a first and supreme Providence
which is the intelligence of the First Deity, or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
as one may regard it, His benevolent will towards all
creatures, in accordance with which all <i>divine</i> things
universally received the most admirable and perfect
order; (2) the second Providence is that of the second
gods, who move through the sky, by which <i>human</i>
affairs are duly ordered, including those relating to the
permanence and preservation of the various species;
(3) the third Providence may properly be regarded as
the superintendence of the Dæmons who are situated
near the earth, observing and directing the actions of
men. But, as we have already noted, this formal
distinction between (2) and (3) is not maintained in
practice. Cleombrotus, who knows more about these
things than most people, insists that it is not possible
that the gods could have been pleased with festivals
and sacrifices, “at which there are banquets of raw flesh
and victims torn in pieces, as well as fastings and loud
lamentations, and often ‘foul language, mad shrieks,
and tossing of dishevelled hair,’” but that all such
dread observances must have had the object of pacifying
the anger of the mischievous Dæmons.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It was
not to the gods that human sacrifices were welcome; it
was not Artemis who demanded the slaughter of Iphigenia;<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
these were the deeds of “fierce and violent
Dæmons,” who also perpetrated those many rapes, and
inflicted those pestilences and famines which are
anciently attributed to the gods. “All the rapes here,
and the wanderings there, that are celebrated in legends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and sacred hymns, all the hidings and flights and
servitudes, <i>do not belong to the gods</i>, but represent the
chances and changes incident to the careers of Dæmons.”
It was not “holy Apollo” who was banished from
Heaven to serve Admetus;—but here the speech
comes to an end with a rapid change of subject, as if
Cleombrotus shrinks from the assertion that a Dæmon
was the real hero of an episode with which so many
beautiful and famous legends of the “hereditary Faith”
were connected. When some of the most celebrated
national myths concerning the gods are assigned to
Dæmons, we are not far away from the identification
of the former with the latter, and the consequent
degradation of the gods to the lower rank. It is true
that the various speakers on the subject do not, in so
many words, identify the Dæmons with the gods of the
Mythology.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> They deprive the gods of many of their
attributes, and give them to the Dæmons; they deprive
them of others, and give them to the One Eternal Deity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
It is difficult to see how the Gods could maintain their
existence under this twofold tendency of deprivation,
supported as they might be by formal classifications
which assigned them a superior place. Even the
Father of Gods and Men—the Zeus of Homer—turns
his eyes “<i>no very great way ahead</i> from Troy to Thrace
and the nomads of the Danube, but the true Zeus gazes
upon beauteous and becoming transformations in many
worlds.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> To contrast the Zeus “of Homer” with
the “true” Zeus is to do little else than to place the
former in that subordinate rank proper not to the
Divine, but to the Dæmonic character. Plutarch is
perfectly consistent in applying this method of interpretation
to the gods of other nations no less than to
the gods of Greece. In the “Isis and Osiris,” he
inclines to the belief that these great Egyptian Deities
are themselves only Dæmons, although he refuses to
dogmatize on the point, and gives a series of more or
less recognized explanations of the Egyptian myth.
He cannot refrain, however, from using so appropriate
an occasion of denouncing the absurdity of the <i>Greeks</i>
in imputing so many terrible actions and qualities to
their gods—“For the legends of Giants and Titans,
handed down among the Greeks, the monstrous deeds
of Cronus, the battle between Pytho and Apollo, the
flight of Dionysus, the wanderings of Demeter, fall not
behind the stories told of Osiris and Typhon, and other
legends that one may hear recounted by mythologists
without restraint.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Such, then, is the relation in which the Dæmons
stand to the Divine nature: they are made the scapegoat
for everything obscene, cruel, selfish, traditionally
imputed to the gods; and the Supreme Deity rises
more conspicuously lofty for its freedom from everything
that can tend to drag it down to the baseness of
human passions. For Plutarch makes it very clear
that it is the human element in these mixed natures
that originates their disorderly appetites. Although
the Dæmons “exceed mankind in strength and capacity,
yet the divine element in their composition is not pure
and unalloyed, inasmuch as it participates in the faculties
of the soul and the sensations of the body, is liable
to pleasure and pain, and to such other conditions as
are involved in these vicissitudes of feeling, and bring
disturbance upon all in a greater or less degree.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It
is by virtue of this participation in the “disturbing”
elements of human nature that they are fitted to play
that part between God and man which Plutarch, after
Plato, calls the “interpretative” and the “communicative.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
This enables the Dæmons to play a loftier
part than that hitherto assigned them; to respond, in
fact, to that universal craving of humanity for some
mediator between their weakness and the eternal
splendour and perfection of the Highest. The whole
question of inspiration and revelation, both oracular
and personal, is bound up with the Dæmonic function,
and to both these spheres of its operation, the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and the private, Plutarch gives the fullest and most
earnest consideration. Previous, therefore, to discussing
this aspect of the Dæmonic character and influence, it
will be necessary to ascertain what were Plutarch’s
views on the subject of inspiration and prophecy, and
what was his attitude to that question of Divination
which exercised so great a fascination on the mind of
antiquity.</p>

<p>An age which attempts to reinvigorate its own
ethical life by draughts of inspiration from springs
hallowed by their duration from an immemorial antiquity,
will naturally regret that currents, which once
ran full, now flow no longer in their early strength, but
have dwindled to insignificant rills, or are dried up
altogether in their courses. And there is no source of
religious inspiration so greatly held in honour as that
which comes from the communication of mankind with
the Divine Being.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Visions, dreams, incantations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
inspired writings, omens, and prophecies have been
valued as means of bringing man into communication
with God, and as furnishing an unerring way of
indicating the Divine will to humanity. But it would
be difficult to mention any institution or practice
having this ostensible aim which has had such absolute
sway over the minds of those who came within reach
of its influence, as the group of oracles which were
celebrated in the ancient Hellenic world. It is no
wonder, therefore, that in the age of Plutarch the
present silence of the oracles was a common topic of
speculation, of anxious alarm to the pious, of ribald
sarcasm to the profane. Juvenal<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> satirically describes
the meaner methods which the cessation of the Oracle
at Delphi has imposed upon those who yet wish to
peer through the gloom that hides the future. Lucan
laments the loss which his degenerate time suffers
from this cause: “<i>non ullo secula dono Nostra carent
majore Deum, quam Delphica sedes Quod siluit</i>;”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and
speculates as to the probable reason for the failure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the ancient inspiration.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> That Plutarch should have
shown solicitude on this aspect of the ancient faith is
natural, and one cannot but be grateful that the
chances of time have preserved the exhaustive tracts
in which he and his friends are represented as discussing
various questions connected with the inspiration
of the Delphic Oracle, and the manner in which this
inspiration was conveyed to humanity. No extant
work gives us so intelligible and natural an explanation
of the significance which oracular institutions possessed
for the ancient world, nor so close an insight into the
workings of the minds of educated men at one of the
most important periods of human history, in face of
one of the most interesting and, perhaps, most appalling
of human problems. We have already made copious
quotations from the two tracts in question; we now
propose to use them mainly for the light which they
cast on the question of oracular inspiration. We refer
to the tracts known as the “De Pythiæ Oraculis” and
the “De Defectu Oraculorum.” These two tracts
(together with the one entitled the “De Ε apud
Delphos”)<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> purport to be reports of conversations held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
by philosophical friends and acquaintances of Plutarch
at the shrine of Apollo at Delphi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The dialogue, briefly called “On the Pythian
Responses,” deals, as the Greek title indicates, with the
fact that the Pythia at Delphi no longer uses verse as
the instrument of her inspired utterances. It takes
the form of a conversation in the Delphic temple,
between Philinus, Diogenianus, Theon, Serapion, and
Boethus—the first of whom reports the conversation to
his friend Basilocles, who has grown quite weary of
waiting while the rest of the party conduct Diogenianus,
a visitor, on a tour of inspection among the sacred
offerings in the Temple.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Philinus<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
    tells how “after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the Ciceroni (οἱ περιηγηταὶ) had gone through their
wonted programme, disregarding our requests that they
would cut short their formal narratives and their
explanations of most of the inscriptions,” the conversation
had turned by a series of natural gradations from
the interesting objects, that so strongly attracted the
attention of visitors, to the medium through which the
oracles of the God had been conveyed to humanity.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
Diogenianus had noted that “the majority of the
oracular utterances were crowded with faults of inelegance
and incorrectness, both of composition and
metre.” Serapion, to whom previous reference has
been made, and who is here described as “the poet
from Athens,” will not admit the correctness of this
impious indictment.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> “You are of opinion, then,” said
he, “that, believing these verses to be the work of the
god, we may assert that they are inferior to those of
Homer and Hesiod? Shall we not rather regard them
as being the best and most beautiful of all compositions,
and reconstitute, by the standard which they supply,
our own taste and judgment, so long corrupted by an
evil tradition?” Boethus, “the geometrician,” who
has lately joined the Epicureans, uses a neat form of
the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> in refutation of Serapion,
paying him a polished compliment at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
“Your own poems,” says he, “grave, indeed, and
philosophic in matter, are, in power and grace and
finish, much more after the model of Homer and Hesiod
than of the Pythia;” and he gives concise expression
to the two opposing mental attitudes in which questions
of this kind are universally approached. “Some will
maintain that the oracles are fine poems because they
are the god’s, others that they cannot be the god’s because
they are not fine poems.” Serapion emphatically re-asserts
the former of these two views, maintaining
that “our eyes and our ears are diseased. We have
become accustomed, by long indulgence in luxury and
effeminacy, to regard sweetness as identical with
beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Theon<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> is the exponent of a compromise
not unknown in modern discussions on the “Inspiration
of the Scriptures”—“Since these verses are inferior to
those of Homer, it cannot be maintained that the god is
their author. He supplies the primary inspiration to
the prophetess, who gives expression thereto in accordance
with her natural aptitude and capacity. He only
suggests the images, and makes the light of the future
shine in her soul.” The conversation then turns upon
certain events which had accompanied, or been preceded
by, portents and wonders happening to statues and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
other gifts consecrated in the Temple. On this subject
Philinus asserts his firm belief that “all the sacred
offerings at Delphi are specially moved by divine
forethought to the indication of futurity, and that no
fragment of them is dead and irresponsive, but all
are filled with divine power.” Boethus, as a newly
converted Epicurean, makes a mock of this view, this
“identification of Apollo with brass and stone, as if
chance were not quite competent to account for such
coincidences,” and he subsequently enlarges his view
as follows:—“What possible condition of temporal
affairs, my friend, cannot be assigned to natural causes?
What strange and unexpected event, occurring by sea
or by land, to cities or to individual men, could one
predict without some chance of hitting the mark?<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
Yet you would hardly call this prediction; it would
be merely assertion, or, rather, the dissemination at
random, into the abyss of infinity, of bare words without
any guiding principle leading them to a particular
end, words which, as they wander about, are sometimes
met by chance events which correspond with them.”
And Boethus continues to insist that, though some
predictions may have by accident come true, the
original assertions were not the less false on that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
account. Serapion admits that this may be true about
vague predictions, but maintains that such detailed
prophecies as those he proceeds to quote from history
do not owe their accomplishment to chance.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The attention of the disputants—if these calm and
dignified colloquies can be called disputes—is here
again attracted to the objects of artistic and historical
interest surrounding them, among which the guide
takes occasion to point out the place where formerly
had reposed the iron spits dedicated by the courtezan
Rhodopis under the circumstances detailed by Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Diogenianus warmly protests against such
offerings having ever been admitted into the Temple,
but Serapion draws his attention to the golden statue
of the more notorious Phryne, “that trophy of Greek
incontinence,”—as Crates had called it—and condemns
the inconsistency of these objections in people who
see, without a protest, the temple crowded with offerings
made by the Greek cities for victories in their
internecine warfare. “It were fitting,” exclaims he,
“that kings and magistrates should consecrate to the
god offerings of justice, temperance, and magnanimity,
and not tributes of a golden and luxurious wealth,
which the most evil livers often abound in.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The concluding portion of this somewhat discursive
tract is devoted to a speech by Theon on the question
with which the title only has so far dealt, the cessation
of the oracle to use verse. Theon, as we have seen,
believes that the god inspires the thought, and not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
expression, of the Pythia, and his explanation of the
change of medium is purely natural, being based upon
the general tendency towards prose which early became
evident in Greek Literature and Philosophy.
Besides, the matters on which the oracle is now
consulted are not such as to require the mystery and
magnificence of verse.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> “In these cases it would be
absurd to employ the diction, metre, and imagery of
poetry, when what is required is a simple and concise
reply. It would be like a vain Sophist to turn an
oracle finely for the sake of show. The Pythian
priestess, moreover, is noble and virtuous in her
own character, and when she mounts the tripod and
approaches the god, she is more intent on truth than
appearance, more regardful of the god’s message than
of the praise or blame of men.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> “In old days,”
continues Theon, “were not wanting those who accused
the oracles of uncertainty and ambiguity, and there
are now those who accuse them of excessive simplicity.
But the ways of such persons are childish and silly:
for just as children take more delight in looking at
rainbows and aureoles and comets than at the sun
and moon, so do these desire enigmas and allegories
and metaphors to fill the heart of man with wonder
and mystery. In their ignorance of the true reason
of the change (in the oracle’s mode of expression), they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
depart, blaming the god instead of charging the defect
to the weakness of our human intellect, which cannot
comprehend the purposes of the Deity.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>In this defence of the Deity Theon has apparently
committed himself to a view of the manner in which
the process of inspiration takes place. “The body
employs many organs, while the soul employs the
body and its parts. The soul, in like manner, is
God’s instrument. Now the virtue of an instrument
consists in imitating, subject to its natural limitations,
the power that makes use of it, and in exhibiting the
thought of that power in operation. This it cannot do
to the extent of reproducing the purity and perfection
of the Divine Creator, but its work is mixed with alien
matter. The Moon reproduces the splendour of the
Sun, but in a dim and weak form. These images are
representations of the way in which the Pythia reproduces
for the service of mankind the thoughts of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> We may be tempted, while reading this
explanation, to assert that Plutarch wishes to maintain
that the inspiration of the Pythia by the Deity is
direct. But these illustrations are intended only to
explain why the Pythian verses are not divinely
perfect. They come through a human soul, which
has the weakness of an instrument, and is prevented
by its limitations from expressing the purity and
beauty of the divine thought. The manner of this
inspiration is more fully discussed in the following
dialogue, the “De Defectu Oraculorum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>This tract is in the form of a letter addressed to
Terentius Priscus, and although the person speaking
as “I” in the dialogue is alluded to as “Lamprias”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
by the other speakers, it is clearly Plutarch himself
who is modestly represented under this guise. After
a warning, characteristic of Plutarch both as regards
its purport and the manner in which it is conveyed
(by means of a historical reminiscence), that these
questions are not to be tested “like a painting by
the touch,” the writer brings a party of philosophers
together at Delphi “shortly before the Pythian games
held under Callistratus.” Two of these philosophers
are already known to us. Like the eagles or swans of
the ancient legend they had met at Delphi coming
from opposite quarters of the globe;<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Demetrius, of
Tarsus, returning home from Britain, and Cleombrotus,
of Lacedæmon, from prolonged journeyings by land
and sea, in Egypt and the East. Cleombrotus, being
possessed of a competence, employed his means and
his leisure in travel, for the purpose of accumulating
evidence to form the basis of that branch of philosophy
whose end and aim, as he expressed it, was Theology.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
A preliminary discussion takes place respecting the
“everlasting lamp” which Cleombrotus had been shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
in the Temple of Ammon, a discussion involving abstract
consideration of Mathematics and Astronomy. In
this conversation, Plutarch’s three favourite characters,
doubtlessly representing three common types of the
day, are again depicted in the pious belief of Cleombrotus,
the scepticism of Demetrius, and the judicial
pose of the Academic Ammonius. The mention of
the Temple of Ammon naturally leads Plutarch to
raise the question of the present silence of that famous
oracle.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Demetrius diverts this particular topic into a
general inquiry respecting the comparative failure of
oracles all the world over.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Bœotia, for example, once
so renowned in this respect, suffers from an almost
total drought of oracular inspiration. While Demetrius
is speaking, the party—Demetrius, Cleombrotus, Ammonius,
and Plutarch—had walked from the shrine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
towards the “doors of the Hall of the Cnidians,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and,”
proceeds Plutarch, “entering therein we came upon our
friends sitting down and waiting for us.” Demetrius
playfully suggests that their listless attitude and idle
expression do not indicate attention to any important
subject of discussion; but Heracleon of Megara retorts
sharply upon the grammarian that people who try
to solve trifling questions of grammar and philology
naturally contract their brows and contort their
features;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> but there are subjects of importance which
people discuss with their eyebrows composed in their
natural way. “Such,” amiably replies Cleombrotus,
“such is the subject we now propose to discuss;” and,
the two groups having joined company, he proceeds to
explain the topic to his hearers. His observations
excite the cynic Didymus, surnamed Planetiades, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
remarkable manner.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Striking his cynic’s staff upon
the ground, he inveighs against the wickedness of the
times, and wonders that the Divine Providence has
not gathered up its oracles on every side and taken its
departure long ago, like the Aidos and Nemesis of
Hesiod. “I would suggest for your discussion the
question why some god has not repeated the feat of
Hercules and shattered the tripod, filled to overflowing,
as it has been, with disgraceful and atheistical requests.
Some of us have questioned the god as if he were a
sophist, anxious to show off his rhetorical skill. Some
of us have appealed to him about riches and treasures;
some about legacies; some about unlawful marriages.
Surely Pythagoras was utterly wrong when he said
that men were at their best when approaching the
gods. Do we not expose, naked and unashamed,
to the eyes of the god such vices and diseases of
the soul as we should shun mentioning even in the
presence of an old and experienced man?”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
going to add more, when Heracleon twitched his cloak,
“but I,” writes Plutarch, “being on more familiar
terms with him than were the others, said to him, ‘My
dear Planetiades, cease your efforts to provoke a god
who is really amiable and gentle, and who has been,
as Pindar says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Adjudged exceeding mild to mortal men.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And whether he is the sun, or lord and father of the
sun and of the whole perceptible world, it is not right
to believe that he would deprive the men of to-day of
the help of his utterances, for he is the author and
supporter of our life, and the master of our intelligence.
Nor is it reasonable to suppose that Providence,
which, like a kind and tender mother, has given us all
that we possess, should wish to punish us in one single
point alone—by taking away from us that prophetic
aid which was once given to us. Just as if the wicked
were not as numerous when the oracles were firmly
established in many parts of the earth! Sit down
again, and, in honour of the Pythian games, make a
truce for once with vice, which you are always eager to
chastise, and help us to find out the cause of the failure
of the oracles.’ The only result of my remarks was
that Planetiades went out-of-doors in silence.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> After
a brief silence, Ammonius turned to me and said,
‘Come, Lamprias, we must be careful not to deprive
the god of all agency in this matter. For if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
maintain that the cessation of the oracles is due to any
other cause than the will of God, we can hardly escape
the conclusion that their foundation also was not His
work. If the prophetic power of the oracles is, indeed,
the work of God, we can imagine no greater or stronger
power than that required to destroy it. Planetiades’
remarks were displeasing to me, particularly on account
of the inconstancy which he attributes to God in His
attitude towards men’s wickedness, now punishing and
now protecting it, as if God were some king or tyrant
excluding vicious men at one door while welcoming
and rewarding them at another. We ought to start
with the principle that God’s action is always marked
by an adaptation of means to ends, that He does not
furnish an excess of what is not required, and should
then observe that Greece has shared in a particular
degree that general depopulation which wars and revolutions
have effected in all parts of the world, to such
an extent, indeed, that the whole of Greece could now
barely furnish the 3000 hoplites which were Megara’s
contingent to Platæa.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> If we were to do this we should
accurately display our own judgment; for how could
the god leave his oracles with us for the mere purpose
of marking the desolation of our land? For who would
be the better if its ancient oracle were still left to
Tegyra, or at Ptoum, where after searching whole days
you can hardly find a single herdsman tending his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
cattle? Even this most ancient and famous oracle at
Delphi is related to have been for a long period reduced
to a state of desolation and inaccessibility by a terrible
monster in the shape of a serpent. But this desolation
is not rightly explained. The solitude brought the
serpent, not the serpent the solitude. But when, in
the great purpose of God, Greece again grew strong in
its cities, and the land was replenished with mankind,
the temple was served by two priestesses, who took
alternate duties on the tripod, and a third was appointed
to be available in case of emergency. But now there
is but one Pythia; and her we find enough for all our
needs. For the prophetic inspiration that yet remains
is sufficient to send all comers away with their requirements
satisfied. Agamemnon employed nine heralds;
and even so he was hard put to it to control the
assembly of the Greeks, so numerous it was. But
within a few days you will have an opportunity of
observing that one voice will easily reach the ears of
everybody in the Theatre here. In a similar manner
the prophetic influence of the god issued by a greater
number of voices when the population was greater.
But as things at present are, the real cause for astonishment
would be that the god should allow the prophetic
agency to waste like water, or his voice to sound in
vain like the cries of shepherds and sheep re-echoing
among the rocky solitudes.’<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Ammonius ceased, and I
remained silent. But Cleombrotus, turning to me,
said: ‘Was it not you who, just now, maintained that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
it is the god himself who not only gives, but also takes
away the oracles?’ ‘No, indeed,’ replied I, ‘on the
contrary, I assert that the god has taken away neither
oracle nor sacred shrine. But just as the god bestows
upon us many other things which are subject to decay
and destruction by natural processes—or, rather, the
original substance, containing a principle of change and
movement in its own nature, often dissolves itself and
reshapes itself without the intervention of the original
creator—so in like manner, I think, the oracles undergo
darkenings and declines, being included in the truth of
the statement that the god bestows many fair gifts on
men, but not one of them to last for ever; or, as
Sophocles has it, “the gods immortal are, but not their
works”’”—“The foundation of oracles is rightly
assigned to God,” continues Plutarch, “but the law
of their existence and its operation we must seek for in
nature and in matter. For it is nothing but the most
childish folly to look upon God as a sort of ventriloquist:
like the fellows once called Eurycleis and
nowadays Pythons, inserting Himself into the bodies
of the prophets, using their mouths and vocal chords
as instruments of His messages. For he who puts God
into this personal contact with human weaknesses and
necessities, sins against His glory, and deprives Him
of the excellence and grandeur of His Virtue.” This
strong insistence upon the splendour of the Divine
Nature is, as we know, one of the most characteristic
elements of Plutarch’s philosophy, and, so long as he
can preserve this intact, he is not careful of consistency
in his arguments on less important points of doctrine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
We have seen him shrinking in conversation from too
close an identification with Rationalism; and we are
also prepared to find him giving importance to a view
which introduces a supernatural element even into the
operation of secondary causes. Hence Cleombrotus is
represented as saying how difficult it is to draw the
line exactly at the direct interposition of Providence in
human affairs; since those who exclude God from
second causes, and those who see Him everywhere, are
equally in error. Hence the pious student of Theology
is permitted to give a full exposition of the doctrines
of Dæmonology as applied to the question of Oracles
and Inspiration. “Plato delivered Philosophy from
many difficulties when he discovered Matter as the
substratum of phenomenal qualities; but those who
invented the science of Dæmonology have solved
greater difficulties still.” We are already familiar with
the nature and activities of the Dæmons; it remains to
see how their existence is applied to the question under
discussion. “Let us not listen,” says Cleombrotus, “to
those who say that oracles are not divinely inspired,
or that religious rites and ceremonies are disregarded
by the gods: nor, on the other hand, let us approve of
the view that God is actively, personally, and directly
concerned in these matters; but let us believe that the
Dæmons are superintendents of, and participators in,
the sacred sacrifices and mysteries, justly assigning
these functions to Lieutenants of the gods, as it were to
Servants and Secretaries, while others go about and
punish great and notorious acts of injustice.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
belief, in the opinion of Cleombrotus, furnishes an explanation
of the silent periods of the oracles. “I am
not afraid to say, as many others have said before me,
that when the Dæmons who have been appointed to
administer prophetic shrines and oracles leave them
finally, then the shrines and oracles finally decline. If
these guardians flee and go elsewhither, and then
return after a long interval, the oracles, silent during
their absence, become again, as of old, the means of
conveying responses to those who come to consult
them.” “But,” says Demetrius, “it is impossible to
assert that the oracles are silent owing to their desertion
by the Dæmons, unless we are first reassured respecting
the method by which the Dæmons, when in actual
superintendence of the oracles, make them actively
inspired.”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Plutarch here introduces a rationalistic
argument imputing prophetic inspiration to subterrestrial
exhalations, and draws down upon himself
the reproof from Ammonius that he has followed up
the abstraction of Divination from the gods by now
depriving the Dæmons of that power and referring it to
“exhalations, winds, and vapours.” Plutarch, however,
though adhering to Rationalism to the extent of insisting
on the operation of secondary causes, saves his piety by
explicitly placing them under the superintendence of
the Dæmons. “There are two causes of generation:
the Zeus of the ancient poets and theologians, and the
physical causes of the natural philosophers. The
study of either of these sets of causes, to the exclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
of the other, leads to defective philosophy. But he
who first made use of both these principles, combining
creative Reason with created Matter, freed us from fear
of criticism either on the ground of impiety or unreason.
For we deprive prophetic inspiration neither of God
nor of Reason when we allow as its material the human
soul, and assign as its instrument the inspiring exhalation.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
The Earth, indeed, breeds these exhalations, but
he that implants in the earth its tempering and transforming
power—I mean the Sun—is regarded as a god in
our ancestral religion. Then, if we leave the Dæmons
as presidents and attendants and guardians, to secure
the due harmonizing of the various elements of the
inspiring exhalation, now slackening and now tightening
it, now restraining its excessive power of phrensy
and confusion, and gently tempering its stimulating
force so that it becomes harmless and painless to
those under its influence—if we adopt these views,
we shall be in perfect harmony with reason and
possibility.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The one thing that is conspicuously evident throughout
these discussions on important questions of Religion
is the earnest sincerity with which they are universally
approached. We notice everywhere that combination
of piety with philosophy, which is characteristic of
Plutarch’s own genius, and which appears to be no less
characteristic of the society in which he constantly
moves. Even the Epicurean Boethus, an excellent man
with his witty stories and courtly compliments, finds it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
somehow in his power to defend the dignity of the
prophetic God against those who would “mix Him up
with every piece of stone or brass,” while those who are
most solicitously inclined to a pious reverence of the
ancient faith—Serapion for a prominent example—never
for long forget that spirit of critical detachment
proper to the inquiring philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> “There is no one
here present,” says Heracleon,“who is profane and
uninitiated, and holds views of the gods inconsistent
with our own; but we must take care that we ourselves
do not unconsciously admit absurd and far-reaching
hypotheses in support of our arguments.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> But it is
Plutarch himself who, shunning the “falsehood of
extremes,” most conspicuously represents this spirit of
compromise. It is Theon-Plutarch who finds a middle
way between the views of Boethus and those of Serapion
on the subject of prophecy, and it is Lamprias-Plutarch
who, knowing that these things involve many contentions
and are open to numerous contradictions, combines
the belief in an original divine inspiration, with a
recognition of the scientific importance of subsidiary
causes, moving unchecked in the sphere of Nature.
“The power of the exhalation which inspires the
Pythia is in truth divine and dæmonic, but it is not
exempt from the operation of causes that bring silence,
age, decay and destruction on all that lives between
the earth and moon.”<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Plutarch here strikes with
clear emphasis a note not out of harmony with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
spirit of modern Theology; and had he pushed this
view to its logical conclusion, as the Epicurean Boethus<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
did, the Dæmons would have disappeared, and their
places would have been wholly occupied by natural
causes operating under the Divine impetus inspired by
the great First Cause. But the necessity for a <i>personality</i>,
human on one aspect, Divine on the other, to
stand between God and man, was too strongly felt by
Plutarch to enable him to accept without qualification
the conclusions of pure rationalism. The blank between
the Creator and His creatures is occupied, therefore,
partly by natural causes, partly by the Dæmons, whose
existence and mode of operation are now involved in
the working of natural causes regarded as under their
superintendence, and now appear as supernatural
agencies vaguely dependent upon the will of the
Supreme Power.</p>

</div>

<p>The evident sincerity of Plutarch’s piety—his
attitude of more than toleration towards everything
consecrated by the religious tradition of his age
and country—render it impossible for us to regard his
system of Dæmonology as a mere concession made by
Rationalism to Superstition.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But it is not the less clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
that Plutarch thinks he has found in the existence of
Dæmons not only a means of communication between
God and man, but a means of reconciliation between
Philosophy and Piety, between Boethus and Serapion.
It is a very happy circumstance for a man’s moral
progress when he finds Religion and Reason in an
agreement so plausible; and when Reason has in some
way furnished the very means of agreement—for was
it not Plato himself to whom most people had gone for
their Dæmonology?—the resulting tendency will have
the strength of two harmonizing influences, instead of
the halting weakness of a compromise between two
mutually conflicting elements.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Plato’s Dæmonology
is a trick of fence: an ironical pose of sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
agreement with popular ideas: but Plutarch does not
see this, and can honestly think himself a Platonist,
a philosopher, even on a question whose settlement
demands philosophical concessions all along the line.
It is true that there was one gain for Philosophy which,
in Plutarch’s mind, would compensate for even greater
sacrifices than it was actually called upon to make:
the gain, namely, that each concession to the belief in
Dæmons would bring into greater prominence the pure
splendour and naked simplicity of the idea of God. As
God was withdrawn not only from participation in the
ignoble adventures of the Homeric legends, but also
from the direct inspiration of oracular and prophetic
phrensy, His character would become more worthy of
the adoration of the Best, while His omnipotence would
be maintained by virtue of the controlling power
exercised by Him over all subordinate powers. The
gain for a philosophic conception of the Deity was so
great in this direction, that we are without surprise in
seeing Plutarch proceed still further on the same path.
The Dæmons by their divine alloy come into close
contact with the nature of God: they perform many
functions as interpreters of the Divine Will to humanity.
But by virtue of the human element in their character,
they are fitted for assuming a personal relationship
with individual men, and for becoming the instruments
by means of which God enters into those ethical relations
with humanity which we have seen described in
the “De Sera Numinis Vindicta.” The hint for this
aspect of their work and influence Plutarch has found
in the Hesiodic people of the golden age, whose death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
promoted them to the duty of keeping watch over the
actions of men. We have seen him already develop
this hint in an assertion that the Dæmons, in addition
to attending on shrines and religious ceremonies, are
endowed with punitive authority over great sinners;
and the ethical value of the doctrine is enforced in a
passage in which the love of justice, the fear of dishonour,
the adoration of virtue, the amenities and graces
of civilized life, are intimately associated with the
belief that good deities and Dæmons keep a watch upon
our career.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> This belief in an intimate personal relation
between men and Dæmons received its most notorious
expression in the famous philosophic tradition of the
Dæmon of Socrates, and it is naturally in a tract with
this title that we have the fullest information respecting
Plutarch’s view of the personal connexion between
Dæmons and men. The essay, “On the Dæmon of
Socrates,” does not, however, contain an exhaustive
and scientific discussion of this interesting aspect of
Theology similar to that given by Apuleius in his tract
with the same designation. At first we find ourselves
plunged into the midst of a most dramatically told piece
of history—the famous Return of the Theban Exiles
under Pelopidas after the treacherous seizure of the
Cadmea by the Spartans. In the pauses of the plot the
Thebans—averse from such studies as their character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
is supposed to have been—discourse on these high
questions of religious philosophy, and one would almost
guess that Plutarch’s subsidiary intention was to indicate,
by the broken character of the discussion, the
difficulty of attaining to a complete and final view of
the subject. Various rational and supernatural explanations
of the well-known Socratic expression are
suggested, explanations which vary in harmony with
the different types of character, or mental attitude,
already familiar in Plutarch. Galaxidorus takes the
extreme rationalistic view. He rebukes Philosophy for
promising to pursue scientific methods in the investigation
of “the Good and the Expedient,” and then, in
contempt of Reason, falling back upon the gods as
principles of action, thus relying on dreams instead of
demonstrations.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> He thinks the Dæmon of Socrates
was nothing but the “last straw” which inclines, in
one direction or the other, a man whose close and experienced
study of every aspect of the case has not
enabled him to come to a practical decision. A sneeze
might be the grain which turned the balance. Phidolaus
will not allow so “great a phenomenon of prophetic
inspiration” to be explained by a sneeze, a method
of divination which “is only jestingly used by common
people in small matters.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> A statement of Simmias to
the effect that he had heard Socrates often inveighing
against those who asserted they had seen a divine vision,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
while he always listened sympathetically to those who
said they had heard a voice, leads to a general surmise
that the Dæmon may have been “not an apparition,
but the perception of a voice or the interpretation of a
word, which had occurred to him under extraordinary
circumstances, just as in a dream there is no actual
voice, but we have fancies and notions of words, and
imagine that we can hear people speaking.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Archidamas,
who is narrating the dialogue and its events to
Caphisias, here expounds his own views on the subject
in the light of the foregoing explanation. He thinks
that the voice, or the perception of a voice, which
influenced Socrates, was the speech of a Dæmon, who,
without the intermediation of audible sound, made this
direct appeal to the mind of the pure and passionless
sage;<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> it was the influence of a superior intelligence
and of a diviner soul, operating upon the soul of Socrates,
whose calm and holy temper fitted him “to hear this
spiritual speech which, though filling all the air around,
is only heard by those whose souls are freed from
passion, and its perturbing influence.”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Here we have
the extreme religious view placed, as usual, in contrast
with the sceptical rationalism of Galaxidorus, which
has also been indirectly opposed by a narrative of the
events, involving the hearing of a Dæmonic voice, connected
with the death and burial of a Pythagorean
philosopher, Lysis, from which it appears that the
Pythagoreans believed that a few men only were under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the guardian care of the Dæmons.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> These two opposing
views having been fully expounded by their respective
defenders, we should now expect the dialogue to be
concluded, in the usual manner of Plutarch, with a
compromise between the rationalistic and the religious
attitudes. But on this occasion we are disappointed.
Plutarch abandons the <i>rôle</i> of rationalist and gives himself
up entirely to the view of Dæmonic influence
expounded by Archidamas, taking Myth for his guide
again whither Philosophy refuses to go. He is careful,
however, as in the parallel case in the “De Sera Numinis
Vindicta,” at once to still the suspicion of the philosopher
and to put the pious reader on his guard, by suggesting
a contrast between Myth and Reason before entering on
the narrative, a warning which is strongly emphasized
by the fact that even Theocritus, “the Soothsayer,” can
only claim for Myth, that it is not to be depended upon
for scientific accuracy, but only sometimes comes in
contact with Truth.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The Myth in this case describes
the experiences in the Cave of Trophonius of the young
philosopher Timarchus, a friend of Socrates, who desired
to ascertain the true nature of the “Dæmon” of that
great man. The story is told with considerable beauty
of imagery, an example of Plutarch’s skill in which
we have already seen in the similar story of Thespesius
of Soli. The soul of the philosopher leaves his body
through the sutures of the cranium. In the subterranean
regions he stays two nights and a day, receiving from
an invisible spirit much information concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
afterworld and the beings who inhabit it. The main
object of the story seems to be to establish and elucidate
the ethical value of the doctrine of Dæmonology, while
at the same time we note that a mystical significance
now begins to be attached to certain principles long
the topic of discussion in the schools. Timarchus is
informed by the invisible spirit that there are four
principles which operate throughout the universe: the
first of Life, the second of Motion, the third of Generation,
the fourth of Corruption. The sphere of Life is
united to the sphere of Motion by the <i>Monad</i> in the
world of invisibility; the sphere of Motion is united to
the sphere of Generation by <i>Nous</i> in the Sun; the
sphere of Generation is united to the sphere of Corruption
by <i>Nature</i> in the Moon. Over each of these
unions a Fate presides. The other “islands” are
peopled by gods: but the Moon is inhabited by
Epichthonian Dæmons, being raised only a little above
Styx, which is “the way to Hell.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Styx periodically
seizes upon many of these souls in the Moon, and they
are swallowed up in Hell. Other souls, at the end of
their participation in the life of generation, are received
into the Moon from below, except such as are “polluted
and unpurified,” these being driven away from her by
thunder and lightning to undergo another period of
generation. As in the myth of Thespesius, there is a
chasm through which the souls pass and repass to and
from the life of earth. “What,” asks Timarchus, “are
these stars that dart about the chasm, some descending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
into its depths, others arising from it?” “These are
Dæmons,” he is told; and we can only conclude that
they are identical with the souls already described as
inhabiting the Moon. These Dæmons are incarnated
in mankind. Some are altogether dominated by the
passions and appetites of the body, others enter into it
only partly, retaining the purest portion of their
substance unmingled with the human frame. “It is
not dragged down, but floats above the top of the head
of a man, who is, as it were, sinking in the depths, but
whose soul is supported by the connexion so long as it
is submissive to this influence, and is not controlled by
its bodily passions. The part beneath the waves in the
body is called the soul; but the eternal, uncorrupted
part is called the mind, by those who think it is within
the body.—Those who rightly judge, know it to be outside,
and describe it as a Dæmon.” The point of this
narrative is emphasized by Theanor, who expresses his
belief that “there are very few men whom God honours
by addressing his commands directly to them. The
souls of such men, freed from the domination of passion
and earthly desires, become Dæmons, who act as
guardian angels to certain men, whose long-continued
struggles after the good excite their attention, and at
last obtain their assistance.” Each of these Dæmons
loves to help the soul confided to its care, and to save
it by its inspirations. The soul who adheres to the
Dæmon, and listens to its warnings, attains a happy
ending; those who refuse to obey are abandoned by it,
and may expect no happiness.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> “The connexion which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
attaches the Dæmon to the soul is, as it were, a restraint
upon the irrational part thereof. When Reason pulls
the chain it gives rise to repentance for the sins which
the soul has committed under the influence of passion,
shame for illicit and immoderate indulgences, and finally
produces a tendency to submit in quiet patience to the
better influence of the Dæmon. The condition of
absolute submission does not come all at once, but those
who have been obedient to their Dæmon from the very
beginning constitute the class of prophets and god-inspired
men.” The Dæmons have here assigned to
them a protective care of humanity; they assist the
souls who struggle after goodness, and desert those
who refuse to obey their injunctions. A few good men,
specially honoured by the deity, may themselves become
Dæmons, and act as guardian angels to others.
Plutarch repeats this view more systematically elsewhere,
giving it a more general application. “It is
maintained by some that ... just as water is perceived
to be produced from earth, from water, air, and from
air, fire, in a constantly ascending process, so also the
better souls undergo a transformation from men to
heroes, from heroes to dæmons, and from dæmons,
some few souls, being purified through prolonged
practice of virtue, are brought to a participation in the
divine nature itself.”<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>This examination of the story of Timarchus lends a
strong support to the statement already made respecting
Plutarch’s use of myth. In the “De Sera Numinis
Vindicta” we saw that he could not accept as a subject
of rational demonstration the theory of rewards and
punishments in a future life; but so convinced is he
of the ethical value of that belief that he has recourse
to a most solemn myth, which he clearly hopes will
operate for goodness through the imagination if not
through the intellect. The myth embodied in the “De
Dæmonio Socratis” has a similar origin and an identical
aim. How important to a man in his efforts after
Goodness to know that he is under the observation of
a Being whose half-human, half-divine nature, fits him
equally to feel sympathy and administer aid! That
is an aspect of Plutarch’s teaching which requires no
emphasis to-day.... With the Plutarchean doctrine
of Dæmons is also involved the sublimely moral notion
of eternal endeavour after a higher and more perfect
goodness. The human being who earnestly strives to
be good within the limits of his present opportunities
will have a larger sphere of activity thrown open to
him as a Dæmon in the Afterworld. The human soul
transfigured into the strength and splendour of this
higher nature has work to perform which may develop
such qualities as will bring their owner into closer
proximity with the Highest Divine. The doctrine of
Dæmons, as expounded by Plutarch, involves the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
profound moral truth that there is no limit to the perfectibility
of human nature; and we can surely forgive
much that is irrational and fantastic in a scheme which
embodies so effective an inspiration to goodness.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>But the value and moral dignity of any principle
depend upon the method of its interpretation and
application. That sense of personal dependence upon a
benevolent supernatural power which Plutarch associates
with the teachings of Dæmonology may be identical
with the purest and loftiest religion, or may degenerate
into the meanest and most degrading superstition,
according to its development in the mind of the individual
believer. If this intercourse is regarded as
spiritual only, the communion of soul with soul in the
“sessions of sweet, silent thought,” high religious
possibilities issue which no form of faith can dispense
with. Any attempt to degrade this intercourse to
material ends, or to appeal to it through material
channels, involves recourse to magical rites, and superstitious
practices of the grossest description. It is
necessary, too, that even where there is no recourse
to materialistic avenues of access to the spiritual world,
the mind should cultivate a belief in the benevolence
of the Higher Powers so that it may maintain a rational
dignity and fearlessness in its communion with them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Plutarch is aware of these clangers. He knows that
Dæmonology, and even Theology, may involve Superstition,
and he takes pains to close those avenues to its
approach, which a misunderstanding of the subject, a
mistaken mental attitude towards it, may easily throw
widely open. He seldom misses an opportunity of
inculcating the proper attitude of mind to assume in
face of questions of Religion, or of placing such questions
in an atmosphere of clear and rational daylight, which
is equally unlike the dim gloom of Superstition, and
the blinding glare of Atheism. In a word, he continues
to make Reason his Mystagogue to Religion. Polemically,
as against the Epicureans, he is inclined to
argue that Atheism is an unmixed evil, since it deprives
mankind of Hope, Courage, and Pleasure, and leaves
us no refuge in God from the sorrows and troubles of
life.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> He adds that Superstition should be removed as
a dimming rheum from before our eyes; but, if that is
impossible, we must not knock the eye out for the sake
of removing the rheum, or turn the sight of Faith to
the blindness of Atheism in order to destroy false ideas
of the Deity. Although he admits that there are some
men for whom it is best to be in fear of God; although
he knows that a much greater number combine with
their honour and worship of the Deity a certain superstitious
fear and dread of Him; yet he insists most
strongly that these feelings are totally eclipsed by the
hope and joy that attend their communion with God.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
He draws a beautiful picture of the happiness accompanying
participation in divine services, asserting, in a
lofty strain of religious feeling, that it is from a recognition
of the presence of God in these services that the
sense of happiness proceeds. “He that denies the
Providence of God has no share in this exceeding joy.
For it is not abundance of wine and well-cooked meats
that gladden our hearts in a religious festival; it is our
good hope and belief that God Himself is graciously
present and approving our acts.” Without this conviction,
he insists, the religious value of the ceremony is
utterly lost.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> To approach the gods with cheerfulness
and courage and openness is the soul of Plutarch’s
religion, and he is faithful to this principle on the most
diverse occasions. Fond of Literature as he is, there
are many famous passages of classical verse which he will
not permit youthful students to carry away into their
lives as factors in ethical progress until they have been
harmonized with the claims of a rational criticism. Thus
he quotes a verse of Sophocles—“God is a cause of
fear to prudent men”—and insists that “fear” should
be changed to “hope,” lest those should be justified who
regard “with suspicion and dread as the cause of injury
the power that is the principle and origin of all good.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
And when dealing with the sanctities of domestic life
he insists that one important element of conjugal
happiness lies in the avoidance of separate worship on
the part of the wife, and in a closing of the door on
superfluous ministrations and the practices of foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
superstition. “For,” says he, “there is no god who takes
delight in stolen and secret sacrifices on the part of a
wife.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> These passages, selected from various portions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of Plutarch’s ethical teachings, show how strongly it is
his practice to emphasize a note of cheerful and open
courage in worship as an essential part of religious
belief. But it is in the well-known essay “on Superstition”
that he most thoroughly expounds this aspect
of his philosophy, and no endeavour to understand
Plutarch’s mental attitude in face of a problem which
always affects humanity would be successful without
a careful analysis of that treatise. The “De Iside et
Osiride” attempts to safeguard the mind from the
attacks of Superstition on the side of the Intellect, as
the “De Superstitione” does on the side of the Imagination,
and the two tracts have therefore an organic connexion
which renders it necessary to treat them together
as expounding different aspects of the same question.</p>

<p>“The profoundest, the most essential and paramount
theme of human interest,” says Goethe, “is the
eternal conflict between Atheism and Superstition.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Plutarch’s tract, “De Superstitione,” is a classical
sermon on this text, although in his presentment of
the subject the mutual antagonism of the two principles
receives less emphasis than the hostility which both
alike direct against the interests of true Religion. He
has no sympathy with any notion similar to that
current since his days, in many religious minds, that
Superstition is but a mistaken form of Piety, deserving
tenderness rather than reprehension, and he maintains
that absolute disbelief in God is less mischievous in its
effects upon human conduct and character than its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
opposite extreme of superstitious devotion. With this
hint of Plutarch’s point of view we proceed to a brief
analysis of the tract in which his view is mainly
expounded.</p>

<p>At the very commencement he describes the two
evils as springing from an identical source. Ignorance
of the Divine Nature has a twofold aspect: in people of
stern dispositions it appears as Atheism; in minds of
more yielding and submissive mould it shows itself as
Superstition. Merely intellectual errors, such as the
Epicurean Theory of Atoms and the Void, or the Stoic
notion that virtue and vice are corporeal substances,
are unaccompanied by any passionate mental disturbance:
they are silly blunders, but not worth tears.
But is a man convinced that wealth is the highest
good? or does he regard virtue as a mere empty
name?—these are errors that cannot be distinguished
from moral disorders. Atheism is an intellectual
error: Superstition a moral disorder—an intellectual
error “touched with emotion.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The moral disorder of
Superstition is depicted in a few paragraphs of striking
power, opulent with historical and literary allusion.
The effect of the description is to leave a conviction of
the utter inability of the superstitious man to free any
portion of his life from the influence of his awful fear
of the gods. “He does not dread the sea who never
sails; nor he a war who never goes to camp; nor he a
robber who keeps his home; nor he an informer who
has no wealth; nor he envy who lives retired; nor he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
an earthquake who dwells in Gaul; nor he a thunderbolt
who inhabits Æthiopia. But they who fear the
gods fear all things—land, sea, air, sky, darkness, light,
sound, silence, dream.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> By day as well as night they
live in prey to dreadful dreams, and fall a ready victim
to the first fortune-telling cheat they come upon. They
dip themselves in the sea: they pass all day in a
sitting posture: they roll themselves on dunghills:
cover themselves with mud: keep Sabbaths:<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> cast
themselves on their faces: stand in strange attitudes,
and adopt strange methods of adoration.—Those who
thought it important to maintain the recognized laws
of Music, used to instruct their pupils to ‘sing with a
just mouth’; and we maintain that those who approach
the gods should address them with a just mouth and a
righteous, lest, in our anxiety to have the tongue of the
victim pure and free from fault, we twist and defile our
own with strange barbarian names and expressions,
and thus disgrace the dignified piety of our national
Faith.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Not only is this life full of torture to the
Superstitious, but their terrified imagination leaps the
limits of the Afterworld, and adds to death the conception
of deathless woes. Hell-gate yawns for them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
streams of flame and Stygian cataracts threaten them;
the gloom is horrid with spectral shapes, and piteous
sights and sounds, with judges and executioners, and
chasms crowded with a myriad woes.</p>

<p>The condition of the Atheist is far to be preferred.
It was better for Tiresias to be blind than it was for
Athamas and Agave to see their children in the shape
of lions and stags. The Atheist does not see God at
all: the superstitious man sees Him terrible instead of
benign, a tyrant instead of a father, harsh instead of
tender. The troubles of actual life are assigned by the
Atheist to natural causes, to defects in himself or his
circumstances; and he endeavours to mitigate or remove
them by greater care. But to the victim of Superstition
his bodily ailments, his pecuniary misfortunes, his
children’s deaths, his public failures, are the strokes of
a god or the attacks of a dæmon, and cannot therefore
be remedied by natural means, which would have the
appearance of opposition to the will of God.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Hence
light misfortunes are often allowed to become fatal
disasters.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Thus, Midas was frightened to death by his
dreams; Aristodemus of Messene committed suicide
because the soothsayers had alarmed him about a
trifling omen;<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Nicias lost his life and his great army
because he was afraid when a shadow crept over the
moon. Let us pray to the gods, but let us not neglect
reasonable human endeavour. “While the Greeks were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
praying for Ajax, Ajax was putting on his armour; for
God is the hope of bravery, not the pretext for
cowardice.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Participation in religious ceremonies,
which should be the most cheerful and happy act of
life, is an additional cause of dread to the Superstitious,
whose case is worse than that of the Atheist who smiles
sarcastically at the whole business. The Atheist, true,
is guilty of impiety: but is not Superstition more open
to this charge? “I, for my part, would greatly prefer
that men should say about me that there was not, and
never had been, such a man as Plutarch, than that they
should say that Plutarch is a fickle, irascible, vindictive
fellow, who will pay you out for not inviting him to
supper, or for omitting to call upon him, or for passing
him in the street without speaking to him, by committing
a violent assault upon you, giving one of your
children a thorough caning, or turning a beast into
your cornfield.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The fact of the matter is, that the
Atheist believes there are no gods, while the superstitious
man wishes there were none;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> the former is
an Atheist pure and simple, while the latter is an
Atheist who professes to believe because he has not
the moral courage to utter his secret desires. And, as
in the individual mind Superstition involves Atheism,
so historically the latter has developed out of the
former. The Epicureans were Atheists, not because
they did not perceive the splendour and perfection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
of the universe, but because they desired to deliver
humanity from the thraldom which Superstition had
cast about it—from its ridiculous passions and actions,
its spells of speech and motion, its magic and witchcraft,
its charmed circles and drum-beating, its impure
purifications and its filthy cleansings, its barbaric and
unlawful penances and its self-torturings at holy
shrines. If these practices are pleasant to the gods,
mankind is no better off than if the administration of
the world were in the hands of the Typhons or the
Giants.</p>

<p>But no disease is so difficult to cope with as Superstition.
We must fly from it, but we must so fly from
it that we do not run into the other extreme. “<i>Aussi
y en a il qui fuyans la Superstition, se vont ruer et precipiter
en la rude et pierreuse impieté de l’atheisme, en
sautant par dessus la vraye Religion, qui est assise au
milieu entre les deux.</i>”</p>

<p>Such is a brief account of the contents of this
famous tract. One thing becomes clear from its
perusal, the fact that the advantage is altogether
regarded as on the side of Atheism. Amyot, from
whose translation we have taken its concluding sentence,
sounds a note of serious alarm in a prefatory
note to his version: “<i>Ce traicté est dangereux à lire,
et contient une doctrine fausse: Car il est certain que
la Superstition est moins mauvaise, et approche plus pres
du milieu de la vraye Religion, que ne fait l’Impieté et
Atheisme.</i>” Others have followed Amyot in his view
of this “dangerous” treatise; while Plutarch has not
been without his champions against those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
thus accused him of irreligion.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> So far as concerns the
views expounded in the treatise, it appears to us that
the alarm of Amyot is justified. But Amyot, who
knew his Plutarch well, should have observed that
there is a note of rhetoric in this work which is totally
different from the teacher’s usually quiet and unimpassioned
method of argument. There is an emphasis,
an exaggeration, of everything that tells against the
victim of Superstition, a restraint, a gentleness in
minimizing the faults which could have been made into
a serious indictment against Atheism. This, as we
know, is not Plutarch’s favourite method of discussion.
In ordinary circumstances an Epicurean would have
attacked Superstition, a Stoic would have inveighed
against Atheism, and an Academic friend of Plutarch’s
would have taken the judicial mean. As a matter of
fact, however, Plutarch—and he connects his own
name with the argument in the most emphatic manner—assumes
a position in this tract scarcely discrepant
from the peculiarly Epicurean attitude. From this
point of view, Wyttenbach’s epithet of <i>vere Plutarcheus</i>
applied to the tract is incorrect, and even Wyttenbach
admits the possibility that Plutarch may have written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
another tract, “in which the cause of <i>Superstition</i> was
defended against Epicurus.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> How Plutarch could
have accomplished a successful defence without going
back on all the arguments in the treatise “on Superstition”
will not be clear to a modern reader. It appears
to us that Plutarch, having an acute perception of the
gross evils inherent in the many superstitious practices
of the day, has been disturbed from his usual philosophic
pose, and has been carried, by a feeling of almost
personal resentment, to draw a picture which was
intended to be one-sided, because it was intended to be
alarming. Plutarch’s Philosophy, his Religion, here
touch the vital interests of life, and come to close
combat with a gigantic moral evil. What is lost in
philosophic detachment is gained in moral fervour, a
change of balance which gives quite other than a
theoretical interest to those many short sermons in
which Plutarch is <i>aux prises</i> with the sins and vices
and follies of his day. The main importance of the
“De Superstitione” is its contact with practical affairs,
and its translation of philosophic and religious conceptions
into terms of everyday life. Philosophy and
Religion have displayed to Plutarch the Purity, the
Unity, the Benevolence of God; it is a question of
Ethics to expose and destroy practices which are repellent
to this conception of the Divine Nature. Plutarch’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
way of solving that question in one direction is expounded
in the tract “De Superstitione.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>While Plutarch, in his anxiety to safeguard the
emotional aspects of Religion from the incursions of
Superstition, departs in this tract from his ordinary
attitude of intellectual moderation, he reverts very
markedly to his usual manner in his treatise on the
two Egyptian divinities, Isis and Osiris. Knowledge
of the Truth is here depicted as the very heart of
devotion, and the pursuit of this is regarded as the
only means of holding a middle path between the bog
of Superstition and the precipice of Atheism. The main
object of this treatise is to show how principles of
rational inquiry may be applied to religious myths, so
that Reason and Piety may both be satisfied with the
result. Wyttenbach explains this purpose in a few words
of terse Latinity which might safely be quoted as descriptive
of Plutarch’s attitude towards Religion in general.
“<i>Consilium scriptoris videtur fuisse, ut amicam de horum
Ægyptiorum numinum ortu et cultu saniora, quam quæ
vulgo ferrentur, doceret, religionemque fabularum deliriis
cærimoniarumque ineptiis mirifice deformatam et apud
prudentiores homines in contemtum adductam, istis quoad
ejus fieri posset sordibus purgaret, omnique literarum
et philosophiæ instrumento ad historiæ fidem, naturæ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
rationem dignamque divinitate speciem reformaret.</i>” But
while serving as an example of Plutarch’s general
method of inquiry, a particular motive for the choice
of this special myth as subject would doubtless be
furnished by the great prevalence and popularity of the
worship of Isis during the Græco-Roman Empire of
this period. Its passionate excitements were hostile
to the calm cultivated by the Roman in matters of
Religion, and Isis had undergone a prolonged struggle
before her temples were allowed to stand erect in Rome.
The patrician indignation of Lucan—<i>nos in templa tuam
Romana accepimus Isin!</i><a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>—expressed, however, rather
the sentiment of the Republic than the conviction of
the Empire. Juvenal alludes to the <i>Isiacæ sacraria
lenæ</i>—the <i>fanum Isidis</i>—the temple of the goddess in
the Campus Martius, in terms which, however severe
from the moral standpoint, leave no historical doubt as
to the established character of the cult and its institutions.
In the later romance of Apuleius, the hero
Lucius owes his re-transformation into human shape to
the power of Isis, and makes a pilgrimage of gratitude
to the very temple to which Juvenal makes so scathing
an allusion.</p>

<p>The detailed description given by Apuleius of the
ceremonies connected with the worship of the goddess
in so important a place as Cenchreæ, the port of
Corinth, bears emphatic witness to the established
popularity of her rites.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Even in Plutarch’s tract the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
fact is everywhere indirectly evident. Clea, to whom
it is addressed, was officially and intimately associated
with the worship of Dionysus at Delphi, but she had
also been instructed from her childhood in the rites
appertaining to the worship of Isis and Osiris.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> It is
only in accordance with Plutarch’s well-known character
that he should be anxious to explain anything
in the Isiac ceremonies and traditions, the misunderstanding
of which was likely to generate superstitious
and licentious practices and lead indirectly to Atheism.
And if, by explaining absurdities, excising crudities,
refuting false interpretations, he could at the same
time demonstrate the unity of God, the identity of
religious basis lying beneath these various beliefs of
other peoples, we can recognize in the task one eminently
suited to the character and aims of Plutarch.
In the “Isis and Osiris” Plutarch has, therefore, a twofold
object. He endeavours to explain, from a rationalistic
point of view, the meaning of Isiac and Osirian
ceremonies and legends; and he develops his theories
on these matters into an exposition of his attitude
towards Myth in general, showing that the various
beliefs of other nations are not, when rightly understood,
mutually destructive and opposite, but simply
different ways of envisaging the same essential and
eternal truth. We proceed to explain these assertions
by an examination of the treatise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Plutarch gives early indication of his point of view.
“The philosophy of the Egyptian priests was generally
concealed in myths and narratives containing dim hints
and suggestions of truth.” It was to indicate this
“enigmatic” character of their theological wisdom that
they erected Sphinxes before their temples; that, too,
is the meaning of their inscription on the shrine of
Athene-Isis at Sais, “<i>I am all that was, and all that
is, and all that shall be, and my veil hath yet no mortal
raised</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> It follows from this that we must on no
account attach a literal significance to their narratives.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
Thus they represent the sun as a newborn child sitting
on a lotus flower, but this is an enigma teaching the
derivation of the solar heat from moisture.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> “It is in
this way,” says he, clearly indicating the twofold object
he has in view throughout this work, “it is in this way
that you are to hear and accept traditions of the gods,
taking their meaning from such as interpret them <i>in
a spirit at once pious and philosophic</i>. This spirit of
reverent inquiry must be accompanied by a constant
observance of the recognized forms of worship, and
by a conviction that no religious or other action is
more grateful to the gods than the acceptance of
true opinions concerning them. This harmonious co-operation
of Piety and Philosophy saves equally
from Atheism and its cognate evil, Superstition.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>It is in this spirit—the spirit in which every
Religion justly claims that it should be approached—that
Plutarch gives an account of the Egyptian myth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
“in the briefest possible terms, denuded of such
particulars as are quite useless and superfluous”;
denuded also, as we are told later, “of its most
blasphemous features,”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> “such as the dismemberment
of Horus and the decapitation of Isis.” Piety
absolutely rejects these tales concerning beings who
participate “in that blessed and eternal nature which
marks our conception of the Divine”; although
Philosophy will not be equally severe on these
legends, regarding them not solely as unsubstantial
tales and empty fictions spun, like spiders’ webs, by
poets and romancers out of their own imagination, but
also as indirectly reflecting the pure light of some
ancient narrative whose meaning has now been utterly
broken up as are the sun’s rays when reproduced in the
multitudinous hues of the rainbow.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Plutarch clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
regards it as a pious duty to accept the Osirian legend
as containing a substratum of truth, embodying the
religious lore of the Egyptian priesthood, but he
reserves to himself the right of interpreting the
expression of this truth in the light of his own
philosophy. His attitude is identical with that assumed
by the authors of the various explanations of
the myth which he reports as current in antiquity.
“These interpretations,” in the lively expression of
Mr. Andrew Lang, “are the interpretations of civilized
men, whose method is to ask themselves: ‘Now, if <i>I</i>
had told such a tale as this, or invented such a mystery
play of divine misadventures, what meaning could
<i>I</i> have intended to convey in what is apparently
blasphemous nonsense?’”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> It will be seen that
Plutarch does not himself finally adopt any special
interpretation, although he emphatically rejects those
which are not pious as well as philosophic. He is
desirous rather of showing in what way the investigation
of such questions should be approached, than of
imposing any definite conclusion on the understanding;
of cultivating an aptitude for rational and reverent inquiry,
than of establishing a final and inflexible dogma.</p>

<p>He deals first with the Euhemerists, or “Exanthropizers.”
Euhemerus of Tegea, or, as Plutarch here
calls him, Euhemerus<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> of Messene, first treated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
scientific precision that tendency to regard the gods as
kings and rulers whose surpassing greatness and merit
had been rewarded by an imaginary apotheosis. He
had embodied the result of his researches, which he
claims to have made during an expedition sent
by Cassander to the Red Sea, in a work called
the “Sacred Record.” He asserted, according to
Lactantius, that he had seen in the Island of
Panchaia (Plutarch calls it <i>Panchon</i>) a column of
gold with an inscription indicating its erection by
Zeus himself, <i>in qua columna gesta sua perscripsit
ut monimentum esset posteris rerum suarum</i>. This
“humanizing” of Zeus was extended to other deities;
and Plutarch, who sarcastically denies that these
inscriptions had ever been seen by anybody else,
whether Greek or Barbarian, asserts that the principles
of Euhemerus had been applied to the explanation of
the tombs and other monuments commemorating in
Egypt the events embodied in the Osirian myth.
Although it has been asserted that Euhemerus admitted
the existence of the elemental deities, such as the sun
and the heavens, the atheistical tendency of his theory
is evident, and the author of the tract “De Placitis
Philosophorum,” whose bias is distinctly Epicurean
and atheistic, says that Euhemerus absolutely denied
the existence of the gods, associating him in this
connexion with Diagoras the Melian, and Theodorus
of Cyrene.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Plutarch himself has no doubts as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
tendency of Euhemerism. Those who have recourse to
these theories,“transferring great names from heaven
to earth, almost entirely uproot and destroy the
reverence and faith implanted in all of us at our
birth, and open wide the temple doors to the profane
and atheistical mob.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>—“They bring divinity to the
level of humanity, and fair occasion of unfettered
speech to the impostures of Euhemerus, who scattered
Atheism the wide world over, degrading all the
recognized deities alike to the names of generals,
admirals, kings of a pretended eld.” Good and great
kings are rewarded with the gratitude of posterity,
while disgrace and obloquy have been the portion of
those whose insolence has led them to assume the
titles and temples of gods.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis of Dæmonic natures, next applied
by Plutarch to the explanation of the legend, we have
already examined. Naturally he expresses a preference
for this theory over that of the Euhemerists, but will
still proceed to discuss with philosophic detachment
the hypotheses of other schools, taking, as he says, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
simplest first.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> These are the Physical Allegorists.
“Just as the Greeks assert that Cronus is an allegorical
symbol for Time, Hera for Air, the birth of Hephaistos
for the transformation of Air into Fire, so also among
the Egyptians there are those who maintain that Osiris
symbolizes the Nile, Isis the Earth, fecundated in his
embrace, Typhon the Sea, into which the Nile falls to
disappear and be scattered, except such part of him as
has been abstracted by the Earth to make her fruitful.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
He shows how this identification of Typhon with the
sea explains certain sayings, beliefs, and practices of
the Egyptians, but he regards it as rather crude and
superficial,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and passes on to an explanation given by
the more learned priests, who, with a more philosophic
application of the principles of allegorical interpretation,
identify Osiris with the <i>Moist</i> Principle of the Universe,
and Typhon with the <i>Dry</i> Principle, the former being
the cause of Generation, the latter being hostile to it.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
The similarity of these views to early Greek speculation
is pointed out by a statement that the Egyptians held
that Homer, like Thales, had learnt from them that
Water is the generative principle of all things, Homer’s
Ocean being Osiris, and his Tethys, Isis. This ancient
theory is fully discussed by Plutarch, showing how the
Egyptians applied it to the myth, but also indicating
similarities of detail and identities of principle between
the Egyptian and Greek mythologies.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> “Those who
combine with these physical explanations certain points
borrowed from astronomical speculation,” are next dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
with. These Astronomical Allegorists maintained that
Osiris is the Lunar World and Typhon the Solar: the
Moon’s light being regarded as favourable to the
reproductiveness of plants and animals, from its greater
moistening tendency, while the light of the Sun is
parching, and so hostile to life and vegetation that “a
considerable portion of the earth is rendered by his
heat totally uninhabitable.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> After a brief description
of another class of astronomical Allegorists who regard
the myth as an enigmatical description of Eclipses,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> he
puts the whole of these particular explanations of the
Physical and Astronomical Allegorists in their proper
place as merely partial and distorted expressions of the
ancient and universal belief in the existence of two
opposing principles, two mutually hostile influences
which operate throughout the universe, giving Nature
its mixed and uncertain and fluctuating character.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
One of the most conspicuous features in Plutarch’s
Theology, as already examined in these pages, is his
anxiety to avoid any kind of Dualism in his conception
of Deity; and it is a necessary corollary of his religious
and philosophical conviction on this point that there
should be no place in the constitution of the world
for a Being regarded as a coequal rival to the One
Supreme Omnipotence. As Plutarch, however, himself
points out, if nothing can be conceived as originating
without a cause, and Good cannot be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
furnishing the cause of Evil, it follows that Evil as
well as Good must have an originating principle of its
own.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But neither on the religious nor on the purely
philosophic side does he carry this admission to the
extent of accepting an Evil personality or principle
equivalent in power to the Deity. On the one hand,
he accepts the doctrine of subordinate Dæmons, whose
evil propensities are ultimately under the control of
the Omnipotent Author of Good, inasmuch as they are
liable to pains and penances for their infraction of the
laws He has imposed upon them; and on the other, he
has learned from Greek philosophy the conception of
τὸ ἄπειρον, that infinite, formless “Matter,” out of
which the Demiurgus, making it the nurse and
receptacle of the ideas, had created the Universe.
He insists, indeed, that the two conceptions are
familiar to Greek philosophers: Empedocles opposed
φιλότητα καὶ φιλίαν to νεῖκος οὐλόμενον; the Pythagoreans
had two well-known lists of contrary expressions.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
Anaxagoras expressed the antithesis by νοῦς
and ἄπειρον; Aristotle by εἶδος and στέρησις. In all
these philosophical distinctions the inferiority of the
second term is implied, and Plutarch asserts this
inferiority in unmistakable terms. “The creation and
formation of this world arose out of opposing, but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
equal, Principles, the supreme sway being the portion
of the Better.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>It is clear from these considerations that Plutarch’s
own mind is made up on the subject; but he cannot
refrain from giving sympathetic consideration to so
ancient, widespread, and respectable a belief as that
involved in the myth of Osiris and Typhon, of Ormuzd
and Ahriman; and he devotes considerable space, and
displays considerable ingenuity, in connecting the
Egyptian and Zoroastrian beliefs with the legends
of Greek Mythology and the principles of Greek
Philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But his object, even when he makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
indulgent concessions to an opposite view, is never
lost sight of, and towards the conclusion of his search
for parallelisms and similarities, he expresses his aim
in unmistakable and peculiarly Plutarchean language.
After passing severe criticism on the impiety of those
who give the names of gods to the productions of Nature,
asserting that Dionysus is <i>Wine</i>, and Hephaistos <i>Flame</i>
(which, says he, is like identifying sail and cable and
anchor with the pilot, the thread with the weaver, or
the draught with the physician), he adds, “God is not
lifeless, unintelligent, subject to man, as these things
are. But it is from these blessings that we conclude
that those who bestow them upon us for our use, and
give us a constant and never-failing supply thereof, are
gods, <i>not different gods among different peoples, not
Barbarian gods, nor Greek gods, not gods of the south
nor gods of the north; but just as the sun, the moon,
the earth, the sky, and the sea are common to all,
but receive different names among different peoples, so
likewise are different honours assigned and different
invocations addressed to the gods in different places
according to the customs there established. Yet is it
one Reason which admonishes, and one Providence
which directs, while subordinate powers have been
appointed over all things. Certain peoples make use
of sacred symbols which, with greater or less clearness,
direct the understanding to divine knowledge, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
not without danger, since some in their desire to shun
the swamp of Superstition have unconsciously slipped
over the precipice of Atheism</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Here we have, combined
in one sentence, Plutarch’s belief in the Unity
of God, his acceptance of the theory of Dæmons, his
recognition of the truth of foreign creeds, his desire, so
frequently expressed, and so consistently acted upon,
to follow the guidance of a reverent yet inquiring
philosophy on a path which is equally distant from
the two great moral evils which loom so large in his
mental vision. Hence this tract is organically connected
with the treatise on Superstition; the former
aims at securing by purely intellectual and rational
processes what the latter attempts by appealing to the
Intellect through the medium of the Imagination.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We have endeavoured in the preceding pages to
ascertain, from Plutarch’s own account of his
views, the principles, the method and the character of
his Religion; to learn in what manner he conceives the
supernatural world and its relation to the human mind
and to human interests; to discover and illustrate the
processes by which these results are attained; to note
their philosophic bearing and tendency; and to exemplify
their application in the sphere of practical
ethics. We have seen how clearly he recognizes the
existence, and demonstrates the attributes, of a Supreme
Being, and have observed how he raises the humility
of mankind nearer to the Majesty of the Highest by
admitting the activities of an intermediate and mediatory
race of supernatural beings, whose mingled nature allies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
them equally to God and Man, and forms a channel
of communication between human wants and divine
benevolence. These are the two fundamental truths
of the religion of Plutarch. The whole of his exegesis,
in whatsoever direction operating, whether examining
the doctrines of Philosophy, the legends of popular
Myth, or the traditions embodied in ceremonial observances,
is involved with a recognition of this twofold
conception as the essential characteristic of a religious
attitude of mind. Those, indeed, who have emphasized
too exclusively that element in Plutarch’s Religion
which he owes to Philosophy, have concluded that his
religious beliefs were purely Monotheistic: just as
a misunderstanding of his Dæmonology has resulted in
the assertion that he was trammelled in the meshes of
a superstitious Polytheism.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> It could, if necessary, be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
plausibly argued, against those who have maintained
this latter view, that the elaboration of the belief in
Dæmons, and the multiplication of the functions of
these lesser divine beings, are factors which tend to
emphasize the unity and purity of the Supreme God;
and that Plutarch’s Monotheism is no more destroyed
by the recognition of a Dæmonic Race than is the
Catholic Trinity overthrown by the Church’s acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
of the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysius “the Areopagite,”
with its thrice-repeated triplets of Thrones,
Cherubim, Seraphim; Powers, Dominions, Mights;
Angels, Archangels, Principalities. But, in the first
place, Plutarch does not keep his Religion and his
Philosophy in separate mental compartments: they are
fused into one operation in his thought; and we should
adopt a false method of interpretation were we to
separate the result as expounded in his writings.
Further, we should obtain a totally misleading view of
Plutarch’s teaching were we to insist that he was fully
conscious of all the conclusions that by a strict use of
logic could conceivably be deduced from his tenets.
An examination of the opinions and beliefs which he
states that he actually maintained leads inevitably to
the conviction that his Dæmonology was as sincere as
his Theology. There can, we think, be no doubt that
his reverence for the national tradition gave him as real
a belief in the polytheistic activities of the Dæmons as
his love of Philosophy gave him in the Unity, Perfection
and Eternity of the Deity. The strength of this
belief was increased by his recognition of the important
part it might play, in one direction by solving perplexities
and removing stumbling-blocks from the national tradition,
in another by responding to that eternal craving of
humanity for a god-man, a mediator, which had already
begun to receive a purer, a simpler, and a more perfect
satisfaction. The conscious expression, therefore, which
Plutarch gives in his writings to the belief in Dæmons,
we are bound to accept as corresponding with a conviction
actually existing in his mind, quite as much as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
we admit the sincerity of his reiterated belief in a
Supreme and Universal Deity.</p>

<p>But it is one of the most interesting suspects of
Plutarch’s Theology—not the less interesting, perhaps,
because it has a certain inconsistency with other parts
of his Religion—that, even were we to confine our
investigations to the philosophic elements of his idea
of the Divine Nature: even if we could totally exclude
from consideration all the functions which he ascribes
to the Dæmonic character: we should still find ourselves
face to face with a God different, in one of the
qualities now regarded as essential to a complete conception
of Deity, from any of the theological representations
current in the schools of Greek Philosophy.
The essential basis of all these representations is the God
of Plato, partly regarded as the creative Demiurgus of
the “Timæus;” partly as the World-Soul, that “blessed
god” produced by the operation of the Creator’s “Intelligence”;
and partly as that ultimate ideal Unity,
the final abstraction reached by a supreme effort of
dialectic subtlety. The last of these three conceptions
is essentially and truly that of Plato; it is the native
and unalloyed product of Dialectic, owing naught of its
existence to the illustrative or ironical use of Myth,
out of which the other two conceptions spring. The
element of personality is totally absent from this conception,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
nor did the Stoics introduce this element into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
their adoption of the Soul of the Universe as Deity.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
But Plutarch’s God is a personal God. The God of
the “De Sera Numinis Vindicta” approaches nearer
to the Christian conception of God as a Father than
the Deity as conceived by any Faith which has not been
permeated by Christian feeling, and the God of the “De
Superstitione” presents the same characteristics as the
God of the “De Sera Numinis Vindicta.” Plutarch’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
feeling of the intimate relation existing between the
Divine Knowledge and the secret weaknesses and sins,
and the feeble strivings after virtue in the human
heart, does not require an elaborate and contentious
process of ratiocination before we can discern its
presence. It is the basis of his finest arguments, and
the inspiration of his most earnest and fruitful teachings.
This weakness of Plutarch on the side of
Metaphysics, this revolt of his nature against the
coldness and distance of the Deity of the Platonic
Dialectic, constitutes his strength as a religious and
moral teacher. This inconsistency makes him the
type of certain modern theologians who will expound
to a formal Congregation the Eternity, Self-Existence,
Necessity, and Unity of God the First Cause, while
in their private devotions their hearts and their lips
turn naturally to the simple and touching petitions of
“Our Father, which art in Heaven;” or, while composing
a sermon in which the particular attributes of
the Persons of the Trinity and their mutual relationships
are defined and enumerated with more than
scholastic precision, will turn and teach their children to
pray to God as the “gentle Jesus.” In a similar manner,
there is the Plutarch of the “De Ε apud Delphos,”
the Plutarch of the “De Sera Numinis Vindicta,” and
the Plutarch of the Dæmonology. He contributes his
share to the discussions of philosophic theologians; he
depicts God in direct spiritual relationship with his
human children; and he describes the Dæmons as
aiding mankind in their internal struggles towards
perfection of moral character. He will allow neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Reason nor Emotion to run away with him; he is as
far removed from the dialectic severities of Plato, as he
is from the superstitious beliefs and practices of the
later Platonists. He has no special and peculiar
message either to the theologian in the pulpit, or to
the child at its mother’s knee. He appeals to humanity
at large; to the people who have work to do, and who
want to get it done with honesty and dignity; to
students, teachers, politicians, members of a busy
society; to people who are liable to all the temptations,
and capable of all the virtues, which naturally arise in
the ordinary life of highly civilized communities. He
analyses and illustrates such common vices as anger,
avarice, envy, hate, flattery;<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> he penetrates and exposes
such ordinary failings as garrulity, <i>gaucherie</i>, personal
extravagance, and interfering curiosity.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> His sympathetic
pen, as of one who knows the value of such
things, depicts with rare charm the loveliness of friendship,
and of affection for brother, child, and wife; while
he applies a more religious consolation to those who
are suffering under the bitterness of exile, the sadness
of bereavement by death.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> To connect Plutarch’s
Religion with his Ethics at all these points of contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
would carry us beyond the natural limits of our present
aim.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> As an illustration of his method as operating in
this direction, we may recall how intimately Plutarch’s
conception of the Divine Nature is interwoven with
his ethical aim in face of so serious a moral evil as
Superstition. We may also add that he is consistent
with himself in constructing no scientifically accurate
system of Ethics any more than he maintains a dialectically
impeccable scheme of Theology. He criticizes
the ethical results attained by various Schools of
Philosophy, and selects from this one and that one
such elements as promise to give greater clearness and
strength to his own convictions.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> He quotes Plato
and Aristotle to show that Reason and Passion are both
necessary elements in the production of practical virtue.
Superior power as Reason is in the constitution of man,
she cannot act by herself towards the accomplishment
of her own virtuous aims. Although he refuses to
agree with Aristotle that all Virtue is a mean between
two extremes, since the virtue of Intelligence as
employed, for example, in the contemplation of a
mathematical problem, being an activity of the pure
and dispassionate part of the soul, needs no admixture
of the unreasoning element to make it effective; he
yet insists that the virtues of practical life demand for
their realization the instrumental agency of the passions,
and are thus, in effect, a mean, correcting excess or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
defect of either of the co-operating agencies.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Referring
to a favourite illustration, he maintains that
the passions are not to be uprooted and destroyed as
Lycurgus uprooted and destroyed the vineyards of
Thracia, but are to be treated with the fostering gentleness
of a god who would prune the wild, trim the rank,
and carefully cultivate the healthy and productive
portions of the plant.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> If we wish to avoid drunkenness
we need not throw our wine away; we must
temper it with water. In like manner, Reason will
not act “by harsh and obstinate methods, but by
gentle means, which convey persuasion and secure
submission more effectively than any sort of compulsion.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
It is quite in harmony with this essentially
practical view of life that he holds that Virtue
can be taught, and that it is through the persuasion,
and by the guidance, of Reason and Philosophy that
a happy life can be secured, inasmuch as their efforts
are directed at counterbalancing the exaggerated picture
which passion draws of all the circumstances of life,
whether they are fortunate or the reverse.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> It is this
principle which he applies to the discussion of topics of
practical morality, as he applies it to the discussion of
questions of Religion. The practice of the virtues
based upon this principle is most vividly exhibited in
his “Symposiacs,” a work which is of considerable value
for the light it throws upon the family and private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
habits of the Græco-Roman empire of that age, but
which is chiefly interesting because it shows to what
an extent the simple and humane moralities of Epicureanism
had permeated Society, and brought a calm and
gentle happiness in their train.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that the positive additions made
by Plutarch to the intellectual and moral wealth of his
age were small and unimportant. He made no great
discoveries in any of the great branches of philosophical
activity which had so long been the special pride and
prerogative of the Hellenic Race. There was not a
tendency of Greek Philosophy with whose history and
results he was not familiarly acquainted; there was not
a School from which he did not borrow something for
introduction into the texture of his own thought. It
is in this sense that he is, as he has been called, an
Eclectic; but his teaching surrounds his appropriated
thoughts with none of the weakness so often attaching
to great and original utterances when torn out of the
systems in which they were originally embodied. Nor
was his Eclecticism that spurious Eclecticism of the later
Platonists, which imagined it had harmonized discordant
systems when it had tied them together with the withes
of an artificial classification. Plutarch’s Eclecticism
was unified by the Ethical aim which constantly inspired
his choice, and gave to old sayings of philosophers, old
lines of verse, old notions of the people, a new and richer
significance in his application of them to the uses of
practical life. Thus, if Plutarch did not add to the
gathered wealth of Hellas, he taught his countrymen
new ways of passing their ancient acquisitions into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
currency. There are periods in the intellectual and
moral progress of humanity when the world is exhausted
with the accumulation of its riches; when its appetite
for acquisition is satiated; when it needs to find what
its possessions are, and how best they can be put to their
legitimate uses. At these periods the cultivation of a
mental attitude is of greater service to humanity than
the accumulation of mental stores. Plutarch came at
such a period in the history of the Hellenic race; and
we, who are once again beginning to recognize that the
end of education should not be the mere accumulation
of facts, but rather the strengthening of the intellect and
the formation of the character, can properly estimate the
value of the work accomplished by one who, on the side
of intellect, inculcated the necessity of sympathetically
watching for signs of a rational basis in beliefs however
<i>primâ facie</i> strange and abhorrent, and on the side of
character, that a man could become virtuous by learning
what his faults were, and endeavouring to check them
by practice and habit. In him Religion and Philosophy
went hand in hand, operating on the same body of truth,
and directing their energies to the realization of the same
end. That rational influence which we saw working
in the sphere of early Roman Religion: which subsequently
gave Roman Morality a source of inspiration
in Greek Philosophy: which associated Greek Religion
and Greek Philosophy as factors in Ethics, until the
latter became the predominating power: this influence
had its final classical expression in Plutarch and in the
other thinkers and workers of his epoch and that immediately
succeeding, in Seneca, in Dion, in Marcus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Aurelius. These men avoided extravagance in Religion,
as they avoided it in their philosophical studies and in
the practical affairs of life. They are the last legitimate
outcome of the Greek spirit in Pagan times. Plutarch
collected the wisdom, and fixed the emotions, of
Antiquity, in a manner which the best men of many
Christian ages have found efficacious for goodness. In
his own more immediate age his spirit predominated
for a century, and was then absorbed to form a thin
vein of common sense in that mingled mass of Oriental
mystery and Hellenic metaphysics which was known as
Neo-Platonism.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Neo-Platonism, which claimed to represent the
perfect harmony of Religion and Philosophy, substantiated
its claim by annihilating the historic foundations
of both, and by thus compelling Christianity to dispense
with the accumulated wisdom of ages in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
reorganization of human relationships with the eternal.
In Plutarch’s teaching, each element of the combination
was at once assisted and restrained by the other, and
the fusion was natural and effective. In Neo-Platonism,
Reason, the principle of Philosophy, and Emotion, the
inspiration of Religion, were each carried to an impossible
extent of extravagance; and it was only the
existence of the two elements in the minds of a few
strenuous and original characters, who were assisted in
their attempts at unity by the refinements of an ultra-Platonic
Dialectic, which secured even the appearance
of harmony between the discrepant conceptions which
they borrowed from various differing and even mutually
hostile schools. Even in Plato the conspicuousness of
the Ethical element compensates to some extent for
the abstractness of his conception of the Deity. But
Neo-Platonism forced the idealism of Plato to a more
extravagant metaphysic; and, although upon Dialectics
the rational part of their doctrine was nominally based,
the abstractness of its processes lent itself to mysticism
as effectively as the purely religious element which
lost itself in the vagaries of Oriental rapture, and
debased itself by its miraculous methods of intercourse
with the spiritual world. Reason, in the pursuit of
the One, was attenuated to Mathematics. Mathematics,
having arrived at the conception of the One, and finding
it without any qualities, gave way to the raptures
of the “perfect vision.”</p>

<p>How far this twofold extravagance was due to the
personality of the founders of the new System, and how
far to its express object of rivalling Christianity, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
doubtful problem. Maximus was a Tyrian; Numenius
came from Apamea in Syria; Ammonius Saccas, the
first great Neo-Platonist, was of Alexandria. Plotinus
came from Lycopolis in Egypt, and was perhaps a
Copt; Porphyry and Iamblichus were Syrians. Plutarch,
as Bishop Theodoret said, was a Hellene of the Hellenes.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
But the necessity of competing with the rising Faith
doubtless operated very strongly in developing the
mystical tendencies always tacitly inherent in Platonism,
and proclaimed by the Neo-Platonists at the very
commencement. This rivalry emphasized that out-Platonizing
of Plato which culminated in the Alexandrian
Trinity, and that competition with the Christian
miracles which issued in the triple folly of Magic,
Theurgy, and Theosophy. Plutarch, knowing that the
necessity of confuting an adversary is liable to cause
exaggeration and distortion, removed his Epicurean
from the scene when he wished to discuss the providential
dispensation of human affairs. The circumstances
of his time, and the bent of his own character,
which inclined him to seek points of agreement rather
than to emphasize points of difference, saved him from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the prejudices of the <i>odium theologicum</i>. But in the
third century Christianity could not be disposed of by
contemptuous phrases, or equally contemptuous silence.
The Neo-Platonists came into direct contact with the
new Religion, both in its literature and in its practice.
Ammonius Saccas, the teacher who satisfied all the
yearning aspirations of Plotinus, had been a Christian
in the days when he was young and carried a porter’s
knot on the quays.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Porphyry informs us that he had
met Origen, and Socrates, the Church historian, asserts
that Porphyry had himself been a Christian. The
evidence of Bishop Theodoret, which cannot be accepted
as regards Plutarch, may easily be admitted as regards
Plotinus.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Porphyry wrote fifteen books against the
Christians, which were publicly burned by Theodosius
200 years later. He demonstrated that the prophecies
of Daniel were composed after the event, and in the
Third Book of his <i>Collection of Oracles</i>, he devotes a
chapter to “the foolishness of the Christians,” and finds
a place for Christ in his lowest rank of supernatural
beings. Plutarch’s thoughts were not disturbed either
by anti-Christian polemic, or by the necessity of finding
a place for Christ in his spiritual world.</p>

<p>The modifications which these influences wrought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
in that body of Hellenic wisdom which had been the
material of Plutarch’s work were most conspicuous in
the Theology and Dæmonology of the Neo-Platonists.
Plutarch had been content to state the Unity, Eternity,
Absoluteness of God. He needed such a conception to
make the world intelligible; but he defined his conception
with a rare simplicity which satisfies the
practical mind as well as meets the essential requirements
of Philosophy. But the Neo-Platonist theology
refines and subdivides and abstracts to an extent which
puzzles and bewilders its most earnest students, and
removes God infinitely further from mankind than even
the Ideas of Plato are removed. “According to Plotinus,
God is Goodness without Love. Man may love God, but
God cannot love man.” Even the “Divine Soul,” the
third Hypostasis of the Neo-Platonist Trinity, that which
lies nearest the comprehension of the common intellect,
“is of little intellectual or religious significance in the
mind of Plotinus.” Dogmatism would be unbecoming
on a subject where Kirchner and Zeller are at variance,
and where the French lucidity of Vacherot and Saisset
casts little more light than the close and careful
analysis of Dr. Bigg.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> But it is necessary to a full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
understanding of Plutarch’s position to consider his
relation to his successors as well as to his predecessors,
and we are therefore compelled to a brief analysis of
the Neo-Platonic Theology and Dæmonology, putting
ourselves under more competent guidance than we can
ourselves hope to supply. “The Supreme Cause,”
says Dr. Bigg, “God, in the proper sense of the word,
... embraces in Himself a unity of Three Hypostases....
Hypostasis signifies the underlying cause of the
phenomenal manifestation. Hence it can be applied to
all three Persons of the Platonic Trinity, while Being
could only be used of the second and third.—Each
Hypostasis is a person, but a purely intellectual person.
All three are one, like three mutually enfolding thoughts,
and where one is there is the All in the fullness of its
power. All are eternal, but the second is inferior to the
first, because ‘begotten,’ and the third to the second, for
the same reason.” “God,” says M. Saisset, “is threefold,
and yet a whole. The divine nature, conceived as
absolutely simple, admits of division; at the pinnacle
of the scale soars Unity; beneath it Intelligence, identical
with Being, or the Logos; in the third rank, the
Universal Soul, or the Spirit. We have not here three
gods, but three hypostases of the same God. An
Hypostasis is not a substance, it is not an attribute, it
is not a mode, it is not a relation. Unity is above
Intelligence and Being, it is above Reason; it is incomprehensible
and ineffable; without Intelligence itself,
it generates Intelligence; it gives birth to Being, and
is not itself Being. Intelligence, in its turn, without
motion or activity as it is, produces the Soul, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the principle of activity and motion. God conceived
as a perfect type of which the human soul is a copy,
the infinite and universal Soul, is the third hypostasis.
God conceived as absolute, eternal, simple, motionless
Thought, superior to space and time, is the second
hypostasis.” But soul and thought and being are terms
relative to the human mind. “God is above thought,
above Being: He is, therefore, indivisible and inconceivable.
He is the One, the Good, grasped by Ecstasy.
This is the third hypostasis.” M. Saisset continues:
“Such are the three terms which compose this obscure
and profound Trinity. Human reason, reason still
imperfectly free from the meshes of sense, stops with
the conception of the Universal Soul, the active principle
of motion; the reason of the Philosophers rises higher,
to the Motionless Intelligence, the depository of the
essences and types of all things; it is love and ecstasy
alone that can carry us to the conception of Absolute
Unity.”</p>

<p>Almost the only thing that is easy to understand in
the Neo-Platonic theology is its adoption of the conceptions
of various schools of Greek Philosophy. This
Eclecticism has a superficial resemblance to that of
Plutarch: but it is Eclecticism formally enumerating
and classifying its results, not harmonizing and unifying
them. The third hypostasis is the λόγος ὁ ἐν τῇ
ὕλῃ of the Stoics; the second hypostasis is the Intelligence,
the eternal, absolute, and motionless Νοῦς of
Aristotle, while the first has striking affinities with the
Pythagorean One. But, by a forced process of interpretation,
all the three Hypostases are found in Plato. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
the “Laws” and the “Phædrus” Plato stopped with
the conception of the Third Hypostasis, the World Soul,
the origin and cause of movement in the created world,
which in the “Timæus” is represented as a creation
of the Demiurgus. In the God of the “Banquet” and
the “Republic,” who is the source of Being and Intelligence,
Plato was anticipating the Second Hypostasis;
while in the “Parmenides” he describes the First
Hypostasis, that absolute Unity which has no relation
with either Being or Reason, or with anything else
either actual or conceivable. The placing of these three
different conceptions of God in three different compartments
of thought, in three different Scales of Existence,
is not to unify them: nor is that process made any the
more feasible by the invention of the term Emanation,
by which the Second Hypostasis proceeds from the
First, and the Third from the Second.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Plutarch’s
Eclecticism is based upon the needs of the moral life:
that of Neo-Platonism was actuated by a desire for
formal harmony, and was steeped in a mysticism which
operated in drawing the soul away from action to a
divine contemplation. The Perfect Vision, the revelation
of the First Hypostasis, is the culmination of the
soul’s progress. The Second and Third Hypostases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
being subject to relations and conditions, are susceptible
of approach through the Reason; but the First
Hypostasis, being unconditioned, cannot be grasped
by Reason, which moves in the sphere of conditions
and relations. Hence, the Perfect Vision repudiates
that Reason of which it is the culmination: “for
thought is a kind of movement, but in the Vision
is no movement.” In the Revelation of the Perfect
Vision, as well as in the formal development of the
Trinity, we see the influence of a desire to compete with
Christianity.</p>

<p>This ecstatic contemplation of the highest conception
of their Theology exhibited a mysticism which
had a more degrading side, one which is specially conspicuous
in the Neo-Platonist Dæmonology. There
also the Mysticism is in combination with refinements
of logical definition. Plotinus takes the floating conceptions
of Dæmonology and makes them submit to
a rigid classification in formal harmony with the tripartite
character of the Divine Nature. Divine Powers
he divides into three classes. The first Power is that
which dwells in the world of Ideas, apart from the perception
of man and in close touch with the Divine
Intelligence. The next is the race of visible Gods, the
Stars, Nature, Earth: the third is that of the Dæmons.
The Dæmons are again subdivided into three ranks:
Gods, Loves, and Dæmons. Porphyry insists on a
similar classification. In one of the oracles collected
by him and preserved by Eusebius, the beings of the
Dæmonic hierarchy are classified with equal strictness,
but with greater simplicity than that shown by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
Plotinus. His highest rank corresponds with that of
his Master. The second rank corresponds with Plotinus’
third class, but does not here undergo a tripartite subdivision.
His third class, unlike the first, which moves
in the presence of God, is far away from communion
with Him, and corresponds with the created and visible
gods in the second class of Plotinus. He is not always
faithful to this simplicity. In the third book of his
“De Philosophia ex Oraculis” he admits another class
of Dæmons called Heroes, admitting Christ to their
number. Elsewhere he divides the Dæmons into archangels,
angels, and dæmons. Proclus will have six
ranks: and Dionysius the Areopagite, who classified
this Dæmonlore for the Christian Church, will have
nine. We can equally discern here the operation of
that spurious Eclecticism which fits its thefts into the
clamps of a preconceived system. The simple notion
of Beings intermediate between God and Man, breaking
the distance between the two by participating in the
Divine and Human nature, is rendered absurd and
impossible by its compulsory harmonizing with the
demand of the Alexandrine Trinity. Plotinus thought
he had made Aristotle agree with Plato, but the
harmony was of the same character as that secured
between Christianity and Neo-Platonism by making the
Christian God-man a Neo-Platonist Dæmon. The
Ideas of Plato, the νόησις τῆς νοήσεως of Aristotle, and
the World Soul of the Stoics: how easy to reconcile
these different conceptions of the Deity, if they are
placed in different spheres of thought, and connected
by the mysterious process of Emanation! The Neo-Platonist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
school was damned by its fatal proclivity for
trinities. There were three kinds of gods, three kinds of
dæmons, and three methods of approach to the supernatural
world. These three methods were of course systematic,
almost scientific, constructions. Before Porphyry
there were Magic (γοητεία) and Theosophy (θεοσοφία).
That philosopher introduced a third and middle term
Theurgy (θεουργία). Theosophy was the process by which
the philosopher attained the Perfect Vision, arrived at
the consummation of ἕνωσις. Magic was the process by
which the evil Dæmons, whom Porphyry puts under
the dominion of Serapis and Hecate, were approached.
The object of Theurgy was communion with the good
Dæmons. Aided by Oriental fervour, we know the
absurdities which these systems developed in the world
of practice. But the development of these sciences on
the theoretical side was enough to drag them down
with their own weight. In Proclus the practical and
the theoretic sides of Neo-Platonism are both driven to
a culmination which passes the intelligence of humanity.
“From the Incommunicable One spring—one knows
not how—a host of Henads. Each has the character of
absolute being, yet each has distinctive qualities. The
Henads run down in long lines; the Intelligible are
followed by the Intellectual, these by the Overworldly,
these again by the Inworldly. From the Intelligible
springs the family of Being, from the Intellectual that
of Intelligence, from the Overworldly that of Soul,
from the Inworldly that of Nature. These principal
‘chains’ are mainly like brooks falling into one river;
that which has a body may also have a soul and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
intelligence; but they subdivide as they go down, there
are different kinds of intelligences and different kinds
of souls dependent on them, so that the river is perpetually
branching off into other rivers. Yet, further,
the principal chains have to be multiplied by the
number of Henads, for each chain is a family depending
on a God, and exhibiting throughout the characteristic
of that God. It includes not only Angels, Heroes,
Demons, and human beings, but stones, plants, animals,
which bear the signature of the deity, and have sacramental
virtues with respect to him.”</p>

<p>If Proclus believed all this, we can understand his
being a victim to the grossest superstition, both in
belief and in practice. In the life of Proclus, second
Aristotle as he was, we see the natural culmination of
that excess of Reason and that exaggeration of Emotion
which had marked the Neo-Platonic attitude from
the beginning. When Justinian closed the School of
Athens in the Sixth Century its professors, the last
representatives of Neo-Platonism, were being hunted
down as practitioners of magic of the meanest description.
The “De Superstitione” of Plutarch marked a
stage in the history of the human mind which the
Neo-Platonists left behind, and which the European
world has only just attained again after centuries of
horrible crimes born of a sincere belief in witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>It is a natural subject of speculation to those who
are interested in the history of this period, how far the
character of modern civilization would have been modified,
had not the free and tolerant traditions of Greece
been clamped into the systematized absurdities of
Neo-Platonism. The struggle for social and political
ascendancy reacted also upon the liberal and gentle
spirit of the Man of Nazareth, whose teachings were
thus embedded in a theological formalism which robbed
them of half their meaning and all their inspiration.
Christianity fought the enemy with its own weapons,
and the scientific terminology of the Neo-Platonists
gave definiteness to the Christian conception of the
Trinity and the celestial hierarchy, while the whole
system of Dæmonology, which has played so sinister a
part in modern civilization, was to be found entire in
the works of Porphyry and Proclus. It has even been
asserted that the chief merit of the Neo-Platonist
school lay in the fact that it prepared the educated
circles of Pagan Society for the acceptance of the
Gospel, and laid the foundations for the construction of
Christian Theology.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> But it is conceivable that had
Christianity come face to face with the calm rationalism
and gentle piety of Pagan Religion and Philosophy as
they appear in Plutarch, more of the spirit, if less of
the form, of the old tradition might have passed into
the teachings of the new Faith. We should, perhaps,
then have been spared the martyrdom of Christians
at the hands of Christians, the Inquisition, and the
whole terrible consequences of the <i>Odium Theologicum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Plutarch suggested a frame of mind rather than inculcated
a body of dogma, and in that he resembled the
founder of Christianity a great deal more than the
most honoured theologians of the Church have done.
But Paganism girt on its armour in direct hostility to
the new Creed, and from these clenched antagonisms
sprang that accentuation of points of difference which
broke the continuity of civilization, and separated the
modern from the classical world by a chasm which the
efforts of four centuries have not succeeded in bridging
over.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Is it not possible that Paganism, which out of
the multitude of separate gods had evolved the idea of
the One Pure and Perfect Deity, might also, out of the
many-sided activities of the half-human, half-divine
Dæmons, have arrived at the belief in a single mediatory
power, and, with a perception unblinded by polemic
bitterness, have been prepared to merge this conception
in the Divine Man of the Catholic Church?<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>But though the spirit of Plutarch was not destined
in this way to pass directly on to the believer in
Christianity, the time was to come when, among the
best and purest adherents of that faith, his teachings
would be regarded as efficacious for the sincerest goodness.
“The works of Jeremy Taylor,” says Archbishop
Trench, “contain no less than two hundred and fifty-six
allusions or direct references made by him to the
writings of Plutarch.” But direct indebtedness of this
kind does not necessarily imply similarity of spirit,
and fortunately the mental attitude of Plutarch is
one which appears essential to human progress, and
does not depend upon the continuity of a tradition.
“Plutarch,” wrote Emerson, “will be perpetually rediscovered
from time to time as long as books last.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
He will be perpetually rediscovered because there
will be a perpetually recurring necessity to look at life
from his point of view. But he will be perpetually
rediscovered because he is perpetually allowed to
disappear. There will always be those among the
disciples of Religion and the followers of Science who
maintain that there can be no truce, no toleration
between the two, and the history of the human race
will be formulated into an indictment against the Superstition
of the one, and the most terrible anathemas of
the Church will be fulminated against the Atheism of
the other. Meanwhile those who take a middle course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and recognize the “immortal vitality of Philosophy
and the eternal necessity of Religion,”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and would
leave the individual mind to select its appropriate
support from the dogmas of the one or the discoveries
of the other, without dressing Philosophy in the fantastic
garb of Religion, as the Neo-Platonists did, or turning
Religion into a matter of rules and regulations as the
Clerical Rationalists of the Eighteenth Century did,
will be regarded by the extremists as traitors at once
to the cause of progress and the cause of morality, and
will be placed among the—</p>

see a copy of either of these dissertations, although Trench also
alludes to Schreiter’s work. They did not, in Seibert’s opinion,
render his work unnecessary; but <i>he</i> enjoyed the inestimable
advantage of the friendship of Zeller, who helped him “libris

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> Attempts have, of course, been made at various times to rationalize
a Religion whose cardinal principle is Faith. Paley and Butler
are conspicuous examples in the history of Anglican Christianity
but neither the one nor the other supplied any widespread inspiration
to the religious life of the day. Butler, “who had made it his business,
ever since he thought himself capable of such sort of reasoning,
to <i>prove</i> to himself the being and attributes of God,” who “found it
impossible to dissociate philosophy from religion in his own mind,”
and “would have agreed with South that what is nonsense upon a
principle of Reason will never be sense upon a principle of Religion,”
was yet compelled to admit that “it was too late for him to try to
support a falling Church;” and it is a matter of national history that
Wesley, with his direct appeal to the principle of “justification by
<i>faith</i>,” did more to reinvigorate the religious life of England than all
the cultured rationalists who adorned the English Church in those
days. And in these later days Butler has not escaped the charge of
“having furnished, with a design directly contrary, one of the most
terrible of the persuasives to Atheism that has ever been produced.”
(<i>Butler</i>, by the Rev. W. Lucas Collins, M.A.) Paley likewise
thought it a just opinion “that whatever renders religion more
rational renders it more credible,” and devoted his genius to the task
of making religion more rational, but has done little more than furnish
a school text-book for theological students. Further, what Christian,
in his heart of hearts, and at those moments which he would regard
as his best, does not respond more readily to the sublime sentiment
of Tertullian than to the ratiocinations of the <i>Analogy</i> or the

“<i>Majores enim expugnantes religionem, totum in experientia collocabant</i>,”

conspiracy as reported by Sallust:—“Non votis neque suppliciis

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> <span class="smcap">Martha</span>: <i>L’Examen de Conscience chez les Anciens</i> (“études
morales sur l’Antiquité”).—“Ce poème, attribué par les uns à Pythagore
lui-même, par d’autres à Lysis, son disciple, par d’autres encore ou à
Philolaüs ou à Empédocle, ne remonte pas sans doute à une si haute
antiquité, mais il est certainement antérieur au christianisme, puisque
des écrivains qui ont vécu avant notre ère, entre autres le Stoïcien
Chrysippe, y ont fait quelquefois allusion ... Hieroclès dit formellement
que les <i>Vers d’or</i> ne sont pas l’œuvre d’un homme, mais celle de
tout le sacré collège pythagoricien.”—The author of the verses is,
doubtless, unknown, but their general attribution in antiquity to a
Pythagorean source is in harmony with the universal recognition
that they cohere with the ethical doctrine of the school. M. Martha
subjects ancient philosophers and critics to a severe reprehension on
the ground that they saw in these verses a mere inculcation of the
practice of the memory—“Un certain nombre d’anciens sont tombés
dans la plus étrange méprise. Ils ont cru qu’il s’agissait ici d’un
exercice de mémoire.” But, giving all the force which M. Martha
assigns to the passages he quotes in support of this view, we must
not leave out of consideration the important part which a good
memory was believed to subserve in practical ethics. See the pseudo-Plutarchic
tract <i>De Educatione Liberorum</i>, 9 F. Cf. <span class="smcap">Epictetus</span>, lib.

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[93]</a> “Through the great weight which, both in theory and in their

(a social development which only became possible after the dissolution
of the bond which had so closely united each individual citizen to the
Civil Community), Epicureanism aided in softening down the asperity
and exclusiveness of ancient manners, and in cultivating the social
virtues of companionableness, compatibility, friendliness, gentleness,
beneficence, and gratitude, and so performed a work whose merit we
should be careful not to under-estimate.”—<span class="smcap">Ueberweg</span>: <i>Grundriss</i>. Cf.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="label">[94]</a> This breaking away of the barriers between the teaching of
various schools was, doubtless, largely due to the increasing importance
which they universally attached to Ethics. The fact, at any
rate, is indisputable. Every history of Greek philosophy, from the
Third Century onward, is freely scattered with such phrases as these
from Ueberweg:—“The new Academy returned to Dogmatism. It
commenced with Philo of Larissa, founder of the Fourth School....
His pupil, Antiochus of Ascalon, founded a Fifth School, by combining
the doctrines of Plato with certain Aristotelian, and more particularly
with certain Stoic theses, thus preparing the way for the transition to
Neo-Platonism.”—“In many of the Peripatetics of this late period we
find an approximation to Stoicism.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> As regards Epicureanism, see the <i>Adversus Coloten</i>, the <i>De
latenter vivendo</i>, and the <i>Non posse suaviter viri secundum Epicurum</i>.
Plutarch’s polemic against Stoicism is specially developed in the three
tracts, <i>Stoicos absurdiora Poetis dicere</i>, <i>De Stoicorum Repugnantiis</i>,
and <i>De communibus Notitiis</i>. Plutarch’s attitude is purely critical:
he is by no means constructive. His criticism has been severely
dealt with by H. Bazin in his dissertation, <i>De Plutarcho Stoicorum
Adversario</i>. It is worthy of note that Plutarch deals entirely with
the founders of the two schools, not with the later developments of
their teachings.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="label">[96]</a> Thiersch, who regards Plutarch as the inaugurator of that moral
reformation which, as we attempt to show in the next chapter, was
operating before he was born, asserts that at the time when Plutarch
began his work, the prevailing manner of life was based upon an
Epicurean ideal. (<i>Der Epikureismus war die Popularphilosophie des
Tages, denn in ihr fand die herrschende Lebensweise ihren begrifflichen
Ausdruck.</i>—<span class="smcap">Thiersch</span>: <i>Politik und Philosophie in ihrem Verhältniss,
etc.</i>, Marburg, 1853.) If this be so, and we willingly make the
admission, there was little need for reform here, although, as Seneca
found (<i>Ad Lucilium</i>, xxi. 9), it may have been necessary to explain
to a misunderstanding world what Epicureanism really was. Whatever
Plutarch, as nominal Platonist, may polemically advance against
Epicureanism, the ideal of Epicurus and Metrodorus is realized in the
conduct of the group of people whose manner of life is represented in
the <i>Symposiacs</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> <i>E.g.</i>, Dr. August Tholuck.—At the termination of an article,
“<i>Ueber den Einfluss des Heidenthums aufs Leben</i>,” in which he ransacks
classical authors and Christian fathers for anything which may serve
to exhibit the degradation of Pagan society, he quotes the words of
Athanasius to give expression to the conclusion referred to in the
text. The whole of Champagny’s brilliant and fascinating work on
the Cæsars is dominated by the same spirit, a spirit utterly inconsistent
with that attitude of philosophical detachment in which
history should be written, (<i>Études sur l’Empire Romain</i>, tome iii.,
“<i>Les Césars</i>.”) Archbishop Trench, too, says of our period that it
“was the hour and power of darkness; of a darkness which then,
immediately before the dawn of a new day, was the thickest.”
(<i>Miracles</i>, p. 162.) Prof. Mahaffy, in the same uncritical spirit, refers
to the “singular” and “melancholy” spectacle presented by Plutarch
in his religious work, “<i>clinging to the sinking ship, or rather, trying
to stop the leak and declare her seaworthy</i>.” (<i>Greeks under Roman
Sway</i>, p. 321.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="label">[100]</a> See “St. Paul and Seneca” (Dissertation ii. in Lightfoot on
“Philippians”) for a full account of the question from the historical
and critical standpoints. The learned and impartial Bishop has no
difficulty in proving that the resemblances between Stoicism and
Christianity were due to St. Paul’s acquaintance with Stoic teaching,
and not to Seneca’s knowledge of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Theodoret, bishop of Cyrus, in Syria (consecrated <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 420), appears
to have been the first to assert the operation of Christian influences
on Plutarch:—“<i>Plotinus, Plutarch, and Numenius, and the rest of
their tribe, who lived after the Manifestation of our Saviour to the
Gentiles, inserted into their own writings many points of Christian
Theology.</i>” (Theodoretus, <i>Græcarum affectionum curatio</i>—Oratio ii.,
De Principio.) In another place he makes a still more definite
assertion: “<i>Plutarch and Plotinus undoubtedly heard the Divine
Gospel.</i>” (Oratio x., De Oraculis.) Rualdus, in the ninth chapter
of his <i>Vita Plutarchi</i>, given towards the end of the first volume of the
Paris edition of 1624, dare not be so emphatic as Theodoret:—“<i>There
are, in the writings of Plutarch, numerous thoughts, drawn from I cannot
say what hidden source, which, from their truth and importance, could
be taken for the utterances of a Christian oracle. I do not hesitate,
therefore, to say of him, as Tertullian said of Seneca, that he is ‘often
our own man.’</i>” And he even goes so far as to admit that, though
Plutarch never attacked the Christian faith, and might have read the
New Testament as well as the Old, it is quite impossible to claim him
as a believer.—Brucker, in a slight account of Plutarch in his <i>Historia
Critica Philosophiæ</i>, takes a more critical view.—“The fact that
Plutarch, in his numerous writings, nowhere alludes to the Christians,
I do not know whether to attribute to his sense of fairness, or even
to actual favour, or whether to regard it as an indication of mere
neglect and contempt.” That Brucker is inclined to the alternative
of contempt is shown by a comment in a footnote on Tillemont’s assertion
(<i>Histoire des Empereurs</i>), that Plutarch ignored the Christians,
“not daring to speak well, not wishing to speak ill.” “It appears
to me,” says Brucker, “that the real reason was contempt for the
Christians, who were looked upon as illiterate.”</p>

<p>Of modern examples of this tendency one may be sufficient. In
the introduction to an American translation of the <i>De Sera Numinis
Vindicta</i>, the editor, after enumerating the arguments against any
connexion between Plutarch and Christianity, concludes:—“Yet
I cannot doubt that an infusion of Christianity had somehow infiltrated
itself into Plutarch’s ethical opinions and sentiment, <i>as into
those of Seneca</i>.” (“Plutarch on the Delay of the Divine Justice,”
translated, with an introduction and notes, by <span class="smcap">Andrew P. Peabody</span>,
Boston, 1885.)</p>

This tract cannot be quoted as authority for Plutarch’s views;
it is in several places distinctly, even grossly, anti-Platonic, and in
other places even more distinctly Epicurean. As an example of the
reverence with which Plutarch constantly alludes to Plato, the first
conversation in the Eighth Book of the <i>Symposiacs</i> may be quoted.
The conversation arises out of a celebration of Plato’s birthday, and
Plutarch gives a sympathetic report of the remarks of Mestrius
Florus, who is of opinion that those who impute the philosopher’s
paternity to Apollo do not dishonour the God. Cf. this and hundreds
of other similar examples with the bitterly contemptuous expressions
in the <i>De Placitis</i>, 881 A, a section which concludes with an emphatic
exposition of that Epicurean view which Plutarch exerts himself so
strenuously to confute in the <i>De Sera Numinis Vindicta</i>. Bernardakis
“stars” the <i>De Placitis</i>, though Zimmerman quotes it as evidence
against the sincerity of Plutarch’s piety (<i>Epistola ad Nicolaum
Nonnen</i>, cap. 7: “aperte negat providentiam”). Wyttenbach says
the <i>De Placitis</i> was “e perditis quibusdam germanis libris compilatum.”
Christopher Meiners (<i>Historia Doctrinæ de Vero Deo</i>, p. 246) attacks
the boldness of the writer, “quâ deorum numen et providentiam
impugnavit, quæque a Plutarchi pietate et moribus longe abhorret.”
Corsini seems to think that the incredible labour involved in the
compilation makes it worthy of Plutarch. His edition, with notes,
translation, and dissertations, makes a very handsome quarto, which
is a monument of combined industry and simplicity. He makes no
comment on the anti-Platonic expressions alluded to above (<span class="smcap">Corsinus</span>:
<i>Plutarchi De Placitis Philosophorum</i>, libri v., Florence, 1759), nor
does Mahaffy either, who regards the <i>De Placitis</i> as genuine, though
he calls it jejune. I have been unable to see a copy of Beck’s 1787
edition, which Volkmann highly praises. It may be observed with
regard to the passage referred to at the head of this note that
Plutarch would never have limited the contribution of philosophy to
the knowledge of God to τὸ φυσικόν. Dion Chrysostom (<i>De Dei
Cognitione</i>, 393, sqq.) mentions the same three sources of the knowledge
of the Divine nature as Plutarch, but also postulates a primeval and
innate cognition of God.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_145" href="#FNanchor_145" class="label">[145]</a> In another place Plutarch expresses the view that the original
Creator of the world bestowed upon the stuff of the phenomenal
world a principle of change and movement by which that stuff often
dissolves and reshapes itself under the operation of natural causes
without the intervention of the original Creator (<i>De Defectu Orac.</i>,

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> Plutarch, in this Essay, distinctly places himself in opposition
to Plato, whose views, for the purposes of contrast, may be summarized
from two well-known passages of the Republic. In 337 B, C, the
greater part of the myths current in the popular poets are repudiated.
Then, after that famous series of criticisms applied to particular
passages taken from Homer and Hesiod and other poets, after his
analysis of the various kinds of “narration,” and his implicit inclusion
of the great poets of Greece among the masters of that kind
of imitative narration which a man will the more indulge in, the
more contemptible he is, Plato concludes with that ironical description
of the reception which a Homer or a Hesiod would have to meet
in a state founded on the Platonic ideal. “<i>We shall pay him reverence
as a sacred, admirable, and charming personage; we shall pour perfumed
oil upon his head and crown him with woollen fillets; but we
shall tell him that our laws exclude such characters as he, and shall
send him away to some other city than ours.</i>”—398 A, B (Davies and
Vaughan’s translation). Plutarch, however, takes the world as it is.
He admits that poetry is a siren, but refuses to stop the ears of the
young people who listen to her fascinating strains. Lycurgus was
mad in thinking he could cure drunkenness by cutting down the
vineyards; he should rather have brought the water-springs nearer
to the vines. It is better to utilize the vine of poetry by checking
and pruning its “fanciful and theatrical exuberance” than to uproot
it altogether. We must mingle the wine with the pure water of
philosophy, or, to use another image, poetry and philosophy must be
planted in the same soil, just as the mandragora, which moderates the
native strength of the wine, is planted in vineyards (<i>Quomodo
Adolescens</i>, 15 E).</p>

<p>August Schlemm, in his <i>De fontibus Plutarchi Commentationum De
Aud. Poetis et de Fortuna</i> (Göttingen, 1893), subjects the structure
of the <i>De Audiendis</i> to a very close and careful analysis, and comes
to the conclusion that the main sources of Plutarch’s material are
to be found in the writings of Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers.
He notes that Plutarch’s examples are taken from the same Homeric,
verses as Plato’s, and adds, “Quæ cum ita sint, quomodo hæ
Plutarchum inter et Platonem similitudines ortæ sint dubium jam
esse non potest. Plutarchus, ut in eis quæ antecedunt, ita etiam
hic, usus est libro Peripatetici cujusdam, qui, <i>ut criminationes a
Platone poetis factas repelleret</i>, hujus modi fictiones in natura artis
poeticæ positas esse demonstravit et commentationi suæ inseruit
poetarum versus a Platone vituperatos.” Chrysippus had composed
a work on <i>How to study Poetry</i>, Zeno one entitled <i>On Poetical Study</i>,
and Cleanthes another, called <i>On the Poet</i>.</p>

<p>The opinion of so conscientious a scholar on Plutarch’s “appropriations”
is worth quoting:—“tenendum est ... Plutarchum non
eum fuisse qui more compilatorum libros aliorum ad verbum exscriberet
sed id egisse ut ea quæ legisset atque collegisset referret,
sed ita ut modo sua intermisceret, modo nonnulla omitteret vel
mutaret.”</p>

says that the main result of the “Ethics” of Plutarch is to show
“how difficult it was for a common-sense man of the world to form
distinct and reasonable opinions on matters of religion in that strangely
complicated time” (<i>Religion in Greek Literature</i>, 1898). But Professor
Campbell is also of opinion that “the convenient distinction
between gods and demons, which he (<i>i.e.</i> Plutarch) and others probably
owed to their reading of Plato, is worth dwelling on <i>because it
was taken up for apologetic purposes by the early Christian fathers</i>.”
Surely its religious value to an age which did not anticipate the
coming of “the early Christian fathers” makes the distinction worth
study from a point of view quite different from that represented in
Christian apologetics.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="label">[175]</a> Plutarch devotes so much of his work to an exposition of his
views of the Divine character, that one feels inclined to regard him
less as a philosopher in the general sense than as a theologian. A
kindly piece of description of his own (see <i>De Defectu Orac.</i>, 410 A),
in which he mentions Cleombrotos of Lacedemon as “a man who made
many journeys, not for the sake of traffic, but because he wished to
see and to learn,” and says that as a result of his travels and researches
he was compiling a practically complete <i>corpus</i> of philosophical
material, the end and aim of philosophy being, as he used to put it,
“<i>Theology</i>”—may be spoken with equal truth of Plutarch himself. We
cannot, perhaps, do better than apply the term Θεόσοφος to him, and
support the appellation with an interesting passage from M. Maury,
in which he deals with the distinction between theosophs and philosophers
in the early stages of Greek philosophy and religion:—“Les
uns soumettant tous les faits à l’appréciation rationelle, et partant de
l’observation individuelle, pour expliquer la formation de l’univers
substituaient aux croyances populaires un système créé par eux, et
plus ou moins en contradiction avec les opinions du vulgaire: c’étaient
les philosophes proprement dits. Les autres acceptaient la religion
de leurs contemporains, ... ils entreprenaient au nom de la
sagesse divine, dont ils se donnaient pour les interprètes, <i>non de
renverser mais de réformer les notions théologiques et les formes
religieuses</i>, de façon à les mettre d’accord avec leurs principes philosophiques”
(<span class="smcap">Maury</span>, vol. i. p. 339). Cf. <span class="smcap">C. G. Seibert</span>, <i>De Apologetica
Plutarchi Theologia</i> (1854):-“Finis autem ad quem tendebat
ipsa erat religio a majoribus accepta, qua philosophiæ ope purgata
æqualium animos denuo implere studebat.” He thinks Plutarch was a
theologian first and a philosopher after. (In the passage quoted above
from the <i>De Defectu</i> it is difficult not to regard Mr. Paton’s emendation
of φιλόθεος μὲν οὖν καὶ φιλόμαντις as more in accordance with the
character of Cleombrotos than the φιλοθεάμων καὶ φιλομαθής of Bernardakis’
text, although, of course, he was a great traveller and an
ardent student.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_231" href="#FNanchor_231" class="label">[231]</a> 561 A.—In the long extract, preserved by Stobæus, from
Plutarch’s <i>De Anima</i> (<i>Anthologion: Tit. 120, 28.</i>—The <i>Tauchnitz</i>
edition of 1838, however, ascribes this passage to Themistius, perhaps
by confusion with extract No. 25), Plutarch allows his imagination
to play freely with the fortunes of the soul in the afterworld. In a
beautiful passage, Timon compares death to initiation into the Great
Mysteries—an initiation in which gloom and weariness and perplexity
and terror are followed by the shining of a wondrous light, which
beams on lovely meadows, whose atmosphere resounds with sacred
voices that tell us all the secret of the mystery, and whose paths are
trod by pure and holy men. Timon concludes with Heraclitus that,
if the soul became assuredly convinced of the fate awaiting it hereafter,
no power would be able to retain it on earth. But Plutarch
himself is not convinced: he is charmed and seduced, but Reason
holds him back from accepting as certainties the “airy subtleties and
wingy mysteries” of Imagination. Under the stress of a desire to
console his wife for the loss of her little daughter, he reminds her that
the “hereditary account” and the Mysteries of Dionysus—in which,
he says, both of them were initiated—equally repudiate the notion
that the soul is without sensation after death (<i>Consolatio ad Uxorem</i>,
611 D). In his polemic against the Epicureans he chiefly emphasizes
the emotional aspect of the desire for immortality;—the Epicurean
denial of immortality destroys “the sweetest and greatest hopes of
the majority of mankind”—one of these “sweetest and greatest
hopes” being that of seeing retribution meted out to those whose
wealth and power have enabled them to flout and insult better men
than themselves; it robs of its satisfaction that yearning of the
thoughtful mind for unstinted communion with the great masters
of contemplation; and deprives the bereaved heart of the pleasant
dream of meeting its loved and lost ones in another world (<i>Non posse
suav.</i>, 1105 E). There is no doubt that Plutarch wished to believe
in the immortality of the soul, but the evidence is not conclusive that
he did; at the most it is with him a “counsel of perfection,” not an
“article of faith.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_232" href="#FNanchor_232" class="label">[232]</a> “<i>It it not clear from the writings of Plutarch to what extent he
was a monotheist.</i>” This is the opinion of Charles W. Super, Ph.D.,
LL.D., and it is supported by the irrefragable proof that Plutarch
“<i>uses θεὸς both with and without the article</i>.” This judgment is given,
of all places in the world, at the conclusion of a translation (a very
indifferent one, by the way) of the <i>De Sera Numinis Vindicta</i>.
(“Between Heathenism and Christianity:—Being a Translation of
Seneca’s <i>De Providentia</i> and Plutarch’s <i>De Sera Numinis Vindicta</i>.”
by Charles W. Super, Ph.D., LL.D., Chicago, 1899.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_233" href="#FNanchor_233" class="label">[233]</a> Plutarch himself is ignorant of its origin, and does not know
whether it was Magian, Orphic, Egyptian, or Phrygian. (<i>De Defectu
Orac.</i>, 415 A. Cf. <i>Isis and Osiris</i>, 360 E, “following the Theologians
of old.”) Those who believed, like Rualdus, that Plato had read the
Old Testament (see note, page 45), had no difficulty in assigning the
doctrine of Dæmons to a Jewish source. Wolff, speaking of the systematic
dæmonology constructed by the neo-Platonists, alludes to this
passage in Plutarch, and says:—“Hæc omnia artificiosa interpretatione
ex Platonis fluxerunt fabulis; ex oriente fere nihil assumebatur.
Namque Judæi aliis principiis, ac reliqui, profecti decem dæmonum
genera constituerant; Chaldæi vetustiores non dæmonum genera, sed
septem archangelos planetis præfectos colebant; nec credendum Plut.,
<i>De Defectu Orac.</i>, 415 A. Studebat enim Plutarchus, <i>præsertim in
Comm: de Iside et de Socratis dæmonio, Græcorum placita ad Ægypti
Asiæque revocare sapientiam</i>, et quum ab Orpheo et Atti sancta
quædam mysteria dicerentur profecta esse, arcanis his ritibus summam
de diis doctrinam significari suspicabatur” (Wolff, <i>op. cit.</i>).—Volkmann,
who had carefully studied Plutarch’s relationship both to his
philosophical predecessors and to foreign forms of religious faith, had
previously arrived at a different conclusion from that embodied in the
words italicized above.—“Er war darum kein Eklektiker oder Synkretist,
und was man nun gar von seiner Vorliebe für Orientalische
Philosophie und Theologie gesagt hat gehört ledeglich in das Gebiet
der Fabel. Plutarchs philosophisch-allegorische Auslegung aber
der Ægyptischen Mythen von Isis und Osiris geht von der ausdrücklichen
Voraussetzung aus <i>dass diese Gottheiten wesentlich Hellenische
sind</i>” (Volkmann, vol. ii. p. 23). But these varying views are simply
two different ways of regarding the real fact, which is that Plutarch
regards foreign myths and Greek alike as different expressions of the
conception of Divine Unity—such Unity not being either Hellenic or
Egyptian, but simply absolute (see subsequent analysis of the <i>De Iside
et Osiride</i>).</p>

Apuleius (the <i>Delphin</i>, of 1688) appears the note “Idem scribit

<p><a id="Footnote_235" href="#FNanchor_235" class="label">[235]</a> “Plato, ne Anaxagoræ aut Socratis modo impietatis reus succumberet,

minus certis <i>et a mera dialectica alienis</i>, obvoluta fabulis” (<span class="smcap">Wolff</span>, <i>De
Dæmonibus</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Is it permissible to suppose that the third consideration—that
expressed in the italicized words—operated more
strongly on Plato than either or both of the first two? Aristotle, at
any rate, takes up a much firmer attitude in face of the popular
mythology, which he regards as <i>fabulously introduced for the purpose
of persuading the multitude, enforcing the laws, and benefiting human
life</i> (<i>Metaphysics</i>, xi. (xii.) 8, T. Taylor’s translation). This famous
passage is as outspoken as Epicureanism.</p>

mysterious.—“Mr. Purser points out to me that Plutarch rather
popularized than originated this doctrine, and himself refers it to
various older philosophers.” (Mahaffy, p. 313.)—It needs no very close
study of Plutarch to see for one’s self that he does not claim to have
originated the doctrine, and that he knows himself to be dealing with
a long-standing and widespread tradition.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_250" href="#FNanchor_250" class="label">[250]</a> The author of the <i>De Placitis</i> (882 B.) gives a very vague and
slight account of the history of Dæmonology, probably from motives
of Epicurean contempt, if one may judge from the curt sentence
which concludes his brief note:—“Epicurus admits none of these
things.”—He merely says that Thales, Pythagoras, Plato, and the
Stoics asserted the existence of spirits called “Dæmons,” and adds
that the same philosophers also maintained the existence of Heroes
some good, some bad. The distinction between good and bad does
not apply to the Dæmons. The identical words of this passage in the
<i>De Placitis</i> are used by Athenagoras (<i>Legat: pro Christ.</i>, cap. 21) to
express a definite statement about Thales, who is asserted to have
been the first who made the division into God, dæmons, heroes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[251]</a> Plutarch has here preserved some very beautiful verses of
Empedocles, in which this punishment is described. Another fragment

and beauty the punishment by the Dæmons of one who has been
handed over to them to atone for his crimes.</p>

when she stated that her fine poem “The Dead Pan” was “partly
founded on a well-known tradition mentioned in a treatise of Plutarch
(‘<i>De Oraculorum Defectu</i>’), <i>according to which, at the hour of the
Saviour’s agony, a cry of ‘Great Pan is dead!’ swept across the waves
in the hearing of certain mariners,—and the oracles ceased</i>.” (It was
one of the mariners who uttered the cry, “The great Pan is dead!”
having been thrice requested by a supernatural voice to do so. But
such errors of detail are unimportant in view of the fact that the
whole spirit of the story is misunderstood by the poetess.)</p>

and who gave the pious traveller much information concerning
Dæmons and their ways; which he was well fitted to do, as he spent
most of his time in their company and that of the pastoral nymphs.
He said that Python (whom Apollo slew) was a dæmon; that the
Titans were dæmons; that Saturn may have been a dæmon. He then
adds the significant words, “There is nothing to wonder at if we
apply to certain Dæmons the traditional titles of the gods, since a
Dæmon who is assigned to a particular god, deriving from him his
authority and prerogatives, is usually called by the name of that same
god” (421 E). But this somewhat daring testimony is, we are not

which is not commonly quoted. Pliny the elder, who in one passage
sneeringly includes the <i>oraculorum præscita</i> among the <i>fulgurum
monitus, auruspicum prædicta, atque etiam parva dictu, in auguriis
sternutamenta et offensiones pedum</i>, by means of which men have
endeavoured to discover hints of divine guidance, nevertheless, in
another passage, quotes two wise oracles as having been “velut ad
castigandam hominum vanitatem a Deo emissa.” (Lib. ii. cap. 5, and
vii. cap. 47.)—The political, religious, and moral influence of the
Delphic oracle has been exhaustively dealt with by Wilhelm Götte
in the work already cited (see p. 127, <i>note</i>), and by Bouché-Leclerq

<p><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="label">[275]</a> The main argument of the third and shortest of the Delphic
tracts has been already given. A brief description of its contents is
added by way of note, to show its connexion with the two larger
tracts. The tract takes the form of a letter from Plutarch to Serapion,
who acts as a means of communication between Plutarch and other
common friends. Its object is to ascertain why the letter Ε was held
in such reverence at the Delphic shrine. A series of explanations
is propounded, probably representing views current on the subject,
varying, as they do, from those proper to the common people to those
which could only have been the views of logicians or mathematicians.
Theon, a close friend of Plutarch’s, maintains that the syllable is the
symbol of the logical attributes of the God, Logic, whose basis is Ει
(“if”), being the process by which philosophical truth is arrived at.
“If, then, Philosophy is concerned with Truth, and the light of Truth
is Demonstration, and the principle of Demonstration is Connexion,
it is with good reason that the faculty which includes and gives effect
to this process has been consecrated by philosophers to the god whose
special charge is Truth.”... “Whence, I will not be dissuaded
from the assertion that this is the <i>Tripod of Truth</i>, namely, Reason,
which recognizing that the consequent follows from the antecedent,
and then taking into consideration the original basis of fact, thus
arrives at the conclusion of the demonstration. How can we be
surprised if the Pythian God, in his predilection for Logic, is
specially attentive to this aspect of Reason, to which he sees philosophers
are devoted in the highest degree?” This connexion of
Reason with Religion, a familiar process in Plutarch, is followed by
a “list of the arithmetical and mathematical praises of the letter Ε”
involving Pythagorean speculations, and the culmination of the whole
piece lies in the splendid vindication by Ammonius of the Unity
and Self-Existence and Eternity of the Deity. Perhaps the most
interesting aspect of his argument is the assignation to Apollo of the
functions of the Supreme Deity: an easy method of bringing Philosophy
and Mythology to terms; a mode of operation perhaps not
unaffected by that Mithraic worship which, on its classical side, was
to culminate in Julian’s famous prayer to Helios. The tract also
furnishes, as already stated, a clear example of the method by which
the literal terms known in the worship of Dionysus and Apollo are
refined from their grosser elements and idealized by the subtleties
of the philosophic intellect, which then accepts them as appropriate
designations for the various functions of the God. The pleasant
seriousness, too, of all the interlocutors is worthy of note, as presenting
a type of religious discussion of whose calmness and dignity
the modern world knows little. It would be interesting, for example,
to hear a group of classical philosophers discuss the excommunication
of Professor Mivart by Cardinal Vaughan, or of Tolstoi by
Pobedonostzeff.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_291" href="#FNanchor_291" class="label">[291]</a> <i>Lamprias.</i> The writer of this letter to “Terentius Priscus” is
addressed by the name of “Lamprias” in the course of the dialogue
(413 E). This Terentius is not mentioned elsewhere by Plutarch,
but one may venture the guess that he was one of the friends whom,
as in the case of Lucius the Etrurian, and Sylla the Carthaginian,
Plutarch had met at Rome (<i>Symposiacs</i>, 727 B). Sylla and Lucius,
whom we know to have been on intimate terms with Plutarch, are
interlocutors in the dialogue <i>De Facie in Orbe Lunæ</i>, and one of
them uses the same form of address to the writer of that dialogue as
is employed by Ammonius in this passage (940 F). There is not the
faintest doubt as to the genuineness of either of these two dialogues,
and it is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that Plutarch, desiring
perhaps to pay a compliment to a relative, veils his own personality
in this way: “Omnium familiarium et propinquorum ante ceteros
omnes Lampriam fratrem, et ejusdem nominis avum Lampriam, eos
imprimis fuisse qui Plutarchi amicitiam memoriamque obtinuerint,
nobis apparet” (<i>De Plutarchi Familiaribus</i>—<span class="smcap">Chenevière</span>). He pays
a similar compliment to his friend Theon, who sums up and concludes
the argument of the <i>De Pythiæ Oraculis</i>. (For the closeness of
Theon’s intimacy with Plutarch, see especially <i>Consolatio ad Uxorem</i>,
610 B, and <i>Symposiacs</i>, 725 F.) Cf. <span class="smcap">Gréard’s</span> <i>La Morale de Plutarque</i>,
p. 303: “Plutarque a ses procédés, qu’on arrive à connaître. D’ordinaire
ils consistent à accorder successivement la parole aux défenseurs
des systèmes extrèmes et à réserver la conclusion au principal personnage
du dialogue. Or ce personnage est presque toujours celui qui a
posé la thèse; et le plus souvent il se trouve avoir avec Plutarque lui-même
un lien de parenté.”—Plutarch delights to such an extent to bring
his friends into his works, that it has even been suggested that no work
is authentic without this distinguishing mark. Readers of Plutarch
know that one characteristic of his style is the avoidance of hiatus,
and that he puts himself to all kinds of trouble to secure this object.
In this connexion, Chenevière remarks: “Mirum nobis visum est
quod, ne in uno quidem librorum quos hiatus causa G. Benseler
Plutarcho abjudicavit, nullius amici nomen offenditur. Scripta
autem quæ nullo hiatu fœdata demonstrat, vel amico cuidam dicata,
vel nominibus amicorum sunt distincta.” (The work by Benseler
referred to is, of course, his <i>De Hiatu in Oratoribus Atticis et Historicis
Græcis</i>.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_292" href="#FNanchor_292" class="label">[292]</a> Plutarch does not, of course, wish to convey the suggestion that
Apollo’s shrine is still the centre of the earth, and that Britain is as
far away in one direction as the Red Sea is in another. The oracle’s
repulse of Epimenides, who wished to be certain on the point,
indicates that the question is one surrounded with difficulty, and that
the wise man will do best to leave it alone. Bouché-Leclerq has a
startling comment: “<i>Plutarque ajoute que, de son temps, la mesure avait
été verifiée par deux voyageurs partis l’un de la Grande Bretagne et
l’autre du fond de la mer Rouge</i>” (<i>La Divination</i>, iii. p. 80).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_295" href="#FNanchor_295" class="label">[295]</a> The cessation of the oracles was only comparative. <span class="smcap">Wolff</span>, in his
<i>De Novissima Oraculorum Ætate</i>, examines the history of each oracle
separately, and comes to a conclusion that the oracles were not silent
even in the age of Porphyry (born <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 232): “<i>Nondum obmutuisse
numina fatidica Porphyrii tempore. Vera enim ille deorum responsa
censuit; quæ Christianis opposuit, ne soli doctrinam divinitus accepisse
viderentur.</i>” Strabo alludes to the failure of the oracle at Dodona,
and adds that the rest were silent too (<span class="smcap">Strabo</span>: vii. 6, 9). Cicero
alludes with great contempt to the silence of the Delphic oracles in
his own times: “<i>Sed, quod caput est, cur isto modo jam oracula
Delphis non eduntur, non modo nostrâ ætate, sed jamdiu; ut modo
nihil possit esse contemtius? Hoc loco quum urgentur evanuisse aiunt
vetustate vim loci ejus, unde anhelitus ille terræ fieret, quo Pythia,
mente incitata, oracula ederet.... Quando autem ista vis evanuit?
An postquam homines minus creduli esse cœperunt</i>” (<i>De Div.</i>, ii. 57).
When Cicero wrote this passage he had probably forgotten the
excellent advice which the oracle had once given him when he went
to Delphi to consult it (<span class="smcap">Plut.</span>: <i>Cicero</i>, cap. 5).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_297" href="#FNanchor_297" class="label">[297]</a> Some of these points of grammar which attracted the scorn
of Heracleon were whether βάλλω loses a λ in the future; and
what were the positives from which the comparatives χεῖρον and
βέλτιον, and the superlatives χεῖριστον and βέλτιστον were formed
(412 E).—“<i>Quelques années après les guerres médiques, le pinceau de
Polygnote couvrit la Lesché des Cnidiens à Delphes de scènes empruntées
au monde infernal.</i>” (Bouché-Leclerq: iii. 153.)—It would have been
more interesting to a modern student if Heracleon had replied that
the pictures of Polygnotus were quite sufficient to keep one mentally
alert, and had seized the opportunity to give us an exact description
of the scenes depicted and the meaning they conveyed to the men of
his time. “‘Not all the treasures,’ as Homer has it, ‘which the
stone threshold of the Far-darter holds safe within, would now,’ as
Mr. Myers says, ‘be so precious to us as the power of looking for one
hour on the greatest work by the greatest painter of antiquity, the
picture by Polygnotus in the Hall of the Cnidians at Delphi, of the
descent of Odysseus among the dead.’”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_298" href="#FNanchor_298" class="label">[298]</a> Didymus, “surnamed Planetiades,” is a picturesque figure, evidently
drawn from life. It is interesting to compare his attitude with
that imposed upon the ideal cynic of Epictetus: “It is his duty then
to be able with a loud voice, if the occasion should arise, and appearing
on the tragic stage to say, like Socrates, ‘Men, whither are you
hurrying? what are you doing, wretches? Like blind people you are
wandering up and down: you are going by another road, and have
left the true road: you seek for prosperity and happiness where they
are not, and if another shows you where they are you do not believe
him’” (<span class="smcap">Long</span>’s <i>Epictetus</i>, p. 251). Planetiades certainly endeavours
to play this <i>rôle</i> on the occasion in question, though he is doubtless as

<p><a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">[311]</a> “As to Plutarch’s theology, he was certainly a monotheist. He
probably had some vague belief in inferior deities (demons he would
have called them) as holding a place like that filled by angels and
evil spirits in the creed of most Christians; <i>yet it is entirely conceivable
that his occasional references to these deities are due merely to the conventional
rhetoric of his age</i>” (<span class="smcap">Andrew P. Peabody</span>: Introduction to
a translation—already referred to—of the <i>De Sera Numinis Vindicta</i>).
It is a little difficult to be patient with the ignorance displayed in the
italicized part of this citation. That Plutarch’s “references to these
deities” are not “occasional” is a matter of fact; that they are not
“due merely to conventional rhetoric” it is hoped that the analysis in
the text—incomplete as it may be in other respects—has at least
made sufficiently clear. It is, however, gratifying to find that this
American translator, unlike Dr. Super, of Chicago, recognizes that
Plutarch “was certainly a monotheist.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_312" href="#FNanchor_312" class="label">[312]</a> Plutarch found the existence of the Dæmons recognized in each
of the three spheres which contributed to the formation of religious
beliefs—in philosophy, in popular tradition, and in law. <span class="smcap">Stobæus</span>:
<i>Tit.</i> 44, 20 (“<i>On Laws and Customs</i>”—<i>Tauchnitz</i> edition of 1838, vol. ii.
p. 164) has an interesting quotation, headed “<i>Preamble of the Laws of
Zaleucus</i>,” in which the following passage occurs:—“If an Evil Dæmon
come to any man, tempting him to Vice, let him spend his time near
temples, and altars, and sacred shrines, fleeing from Vice as from an
impious and cruel mistress, and let him pray the gods to deliver him
from her power.” Zaleucus may, of course, have been embodying the
teaching of his Pythagorean colleagues, but the fact remains that the
belief in the influence of Dæmons on human life received the authority
of a celebrated system of law, unless we are to be more incredulous
than Cicero himself—<i>Quis Zaleucum leges scripsisse non dixit?</i> (<i>Ad
Atticum</i>, vi. 1).—(“His code is stated to have been the first collection
of written laws that the Greeks possessed.”—<i>Smaller Classical
Dictionary</i>, Smith and Marindin, 1898.)</p>

spend all their time on the moon; they take charge of oracles, assist
at initiatory rites, punish evildoers, help men in battle and at sea,

to Christianity. But why not also in <span class="smcap">Plato</span>’s <i>Laws</i>, 674 F, and 661
C?—It is quite in harmony with Plutarch’s love of openness in
Religion that to the general reticence displayed by the Greeks on
the subject of their religious Mysteries, he seems to add a personal
reticence peculiarly his own. Considering how anxiously he hovers
about the question of the soul’s immortality (see above, p. 118, and cf.
<i>Consolatio ad Apollonium</i>, 120 B, C: “<i>If, as is probable, there is any
truth in the sayings of ancient poets and philosophers ... then must
you cherish fair hopes of your dear departed son</i>”—a passage
curiously similar in form and thought to <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span>, <i>Agric.</i> 46: “<i>Si
quis piorum manibus locus, si, ut sapientibus placet</i>,” <i>&amp;c.</i>), it is remarkable
that only once—and then under the stress of a bitter domestic
bereavement—does he specifically quote the Mysteries (those of
Dionysus) as inculcating that doctrine (<i>Ad Uxorem</i>, 611 D). His
adoption of an unknown writer’s beautiful comparison of Sleep to the
Lesser Mysteries of Death (<i>Consol. ad Apoll.</i>, 107 E), and his repetition
of the same idea elsewhere (see above, p. 118), may also be
indications how naturally the teaching of the Mysteries suggested
the idea of immortality. But he most frequently alludes to the
Mysteries as secret sources of information for the identification of
nominally different deities (<i>De Iside et Osiride</i>, 364 E), or for the
assignation of their proper functions to the Dæmons (<i>De Defectu</i>,
417 C), who are regarded as responsible for what Mr. Andrew Lang
(“Myth, Ritual, and Religion,” <i>passim</i>) calls “the barbaric and
licentious part of the performances” (<i>De Iside et Osiride</i>, 360 E, F).
We should perhaps conclude, from the few indications which Plutarch
gives of his views on this subject, that he regarded the Mysteries in
a twofold light; they were a source of religious instruction, or consolation,
respecting the future state of the soul, and they were also
a means of explaining and justifying the crude legends which so
largely intermingled with the purer elements of Greek religion.
Though, as Plutarch hints, many of these barbaric legends were not
suited to discussion by the profane, yet the mind, when purified by
sacred rites, and educated to the apprehension of sacred meanings,
could grasp the high and pure significance of things which were a
stumbling-block to the uninitiated, and could make them an aid to
a loftier moral life.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_369" href="#FNanchor_369" class="label">[369]</a> See especially the quotations from Plato in 370 F, and the
application of Platonic terms in the interpretation of the Isiac and
Osirian myth in 372 E, F, 373 and 374. Hesiod, too, is made to
agree with this Platonic explanation of the Egyptian legend (374 C),
and the Platonic notion of matter is strained to allow of its being
identified with Isis (372 E, 374 F). In 367 C, a parallelism is
pointed out between Stoic theology and an interpretation of the myth;
and in 367 E the death of Osiris on the 17th of the month is used
to illustrate, if not to explain, the Pythagorean ἀφοσίωσις of that
number.</p>

<p>As regards the identification of particular deities in this tract,
reference may be made to 364 E, F and 365 A, B, where Dionysus
is identified with Osiris; and to 365 F, where Mnaseas of Patara is
mentioned with approval as associating with Epaphus, not only
Dionysus, but Serapis and Osiris also. Anticleides is also referred
to as asserting that Isis was the daughter of Prometheus and the wife
of Dionysus. In 372 D, Osiris is identified with the Sun under the
name of Sirius, and Isis with the Moon, in 375, a fanciful philology
is called in to aid a further identification of Greek and Egyptian
deities; but not much importance is attached to similarities derived
in this way. In the next sentence Isis is stated to have been identified
with Athene by the Egyptians; and the general principle of identity
is boldly stated in 377 C:—“<i>It is quite legitimate to regard these gods
as common possessions and not the exclusive property of the Egyptians—Isis
and the deities that go in her train are universally known and
worshipped. The names, indeed, of certain of them have been borrowed
from the Egyptians, not so long ago; but their divinity has been known
and recognized for ages.</i>”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_371" href="#FNanchor_371" class="label">[371]</a> There is a strain of mysticism in the <i>De Osiride</i> which is alien
from the cheerful common sense which usually marks Plutarch; a
remark which also applies to the <i>De Facie quæ apparet in Orbe Lunæ</i>.
But the same strain appears in others of his authentic tracts, though
mostly operating through the medium of Platonic dreams and myths,
<i>e.g.</i> the story of Thespesius in the <i>Sera Num. Vindic.</i>, and that of
Timarchus in the <i>De Dæmonio Socratis</i>. Besides, one would not
ceteris paribus deny the authenticity of Browning’s “<i>Childe Roland</i>”
because he had written “<i>The Guardian Angel</i>,” or that of “<i>The
Antiquary</i>” because Scott was also the author of “<i>The Monastery</i>.”
The tract was probably composed after that return from Alexandria
to which Plutarch so charmingly alludes in <i>Sympos.</i>, 678 C. Moreover,
the very nature of the subject, and the priestly character of the
lady to whom it was addressed, as well as the mysterious nature of the
goddess whose ministrant she was, are all parts of a natural inducement
to mysticism. We must admit that Plutarch here participates in
that spirit of mysticism which, always inherent in Platonism, was kept
in check by his acutely practical bent, to be revived and exaggerated
to the destruction of practical ethics in the dreams and abstractions
of the Neo-Platonists.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_372" href="#FNanchor_372" class="label">[372]</a> A very slight acquaintance with Plutarch’s writings will serve
to dispose of the charge of Atheism brought against him by Zimmerman,
the professor of Theology in the Gymnasium of Zurich:—Credo
equidem Plutarchum inter eos fuisse qui cum Cicerone crediderint
eos qui dant philosophiæ operam non arbitrari Deos esse.—It
is true that Zimmerman supports his case by quoting the pseudo-Plutarchean
<i>De Placitis</i> (Idem de providentia non minus male loquitur
quam ipsi Epicurei), and seems himself afraid to accept the conclusion
of his own demonstrations:—Atheum eum fuisse non credo, sed quomodo
asserere potuerit Superstitione Atheismum tolerabiliorem esse,
simul tamen eos, quos atheos fuisse minime probare potuit, Superstitioni
autem inimicissimos, omnem malorum mundum intulisse, consociare
nequeo.—But the learned author is too intent on exculpating
<i>Noster Euhemerus</i> from Plutarch’s “injustice” to have justice to spare
for Plutarch himself.—(J. J. <span class="smcap">Zimmerman</span>, <i>Epistola ad Nonnen</i>). Gréard
quotes other authors of this charge against Plutarch (p. 269).—We
cannot allow this opportunity to pass of protesting against the attitude
of those who assumed, even in the Nineteenth Century, that it was a
sign either of moral depravity, or mental incapacity, in Plutarch not
to have been a believer in the Christian faith. Even Archbishop
Trench, who admits, concerning such writers as our author, that
“many were by them enabled to live their lives after a far higher and
nobler fashion than else they would have attained” cannot rid himself
of the notion that had Plutarch actively opposed Christianity he
would have committed an offence which our generosity might have
pardoned, though our justice must recognize that it <i>needed</i> pardon.
“Plutarch himself may be entirely acquitted of any <i>conscious</i> attempt
to fight against that truth which was higher than any which he had”
(p. 13).—“I have already mentioned that, <i>through no fault of his own</i>,
he stood removed from all the immediate influences of the Christian
Church” (p. 89). But suppose the facts to have been just the opposite
of those indicated in the words we have italicized, it would involve
the loss of all sense of historical perspective to draw the conclusion
which would clearly have been drawn by Trench himself. The use
of similar language by Prof. Mahaffy has already been noted. (Pref.
p. xii.) The position assumed by writers who maintain this view, is
one quite inappropriate for historical discussion, and its natural expression,
if it must be expressed at all, is through the medium of such
poetical aspirations as that breathed in the epigram of John, the
Metropolitan of Euchaita:—</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_373" href="#FNanchor_373" class="label">[373]</a> Dr. Martineau (<i>Types of Ethical Theory</i>, vol. i. p. 91) thinks
that “we must go a little further than Zeller, who decides that Plato
usually conceived of God as if personal, yet was restrained by a
doctrine inconsistent with such conception from approaching it closely
or setting it deliberately on any scientific ground,” and devotes several
closely-reasoned pages to show that, although there was no room for
a personal god in Plato’s philosophy, Plato himself was in distinct
opposition to his own views as systematically expounded in his
writings. “We may regard him as fully aware of the conditions of
the problem, and, though unable to solve it without lesion of his
dialectic, yet deliberately pronouncing judgment on the side of his
religious feeling.” But <i>pace tantorum virorum</i> it will be admitted that
the personality of God is not very evident in Plato when those who
understand him best can only maintain that it is not essentially interwoven
with his philosophy, having only an indirect and accidental
existence which is not possible “without lesion of his dialectic.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_374" href="#FNanchor_374" class="label">[374]</a> “Abstractedly, the theology of the Stoics appears as a materialistic
pantheism; God is represented as a fire, and the world as a mode
of God.” (<span class="smcap">Grant</span>, <i>The Ethics of Aristotle</i>, vol. i. p. 265.) In the
famous “hymn of Cleanthes,” preserved, like so many other of the
great wonders of classical literature, by Stobæus, Grant sees an
emphatic recognition of the personality of God, but it is equally
natural to regard the hymn as a more detailed expression of that
necessity of submitting to Destiny—of living in accordance with
nature—which Cleanthes enounces in that other famous fragment
which Epictetus would have us hold ready to hand in all the circumstances
of life:—</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_384" href="#FNanchor_384" class="label">[384]</a> Trench follows Zeller in regarding Plutarch as a forerunner of
the Neo-Platonists:—“Plutarch was a Platonist, with an oriental
tinge, and thus a forerunner of the new Platonists, who ever regarded
him with the highest honour. Their proper founder, indeed, he, more
than any other man, deserves to be called, though clear of many of
the unhealthy excesses into which, at a later date, many of them ran”
(Trench, p. 90). We hope our pages have done something towards
putting Plutarch in a different light from that which surrounds him
here. As a matter of fact, did the “new Platonists regard him ever
with the highest honour?” The testimony of Eunapius we have
already quoted (p. 67, note). Himerius is equally laudatory. “Plutarch,
who is the source of all the instruction you convey.”—<i>Eclogæ</i>,
vii. 4. “I weep for one who, I fondly hoped, would be gifted
with speech excelling Minucianus in force, Nicagoras in stateliness,
Plutarch in sweetness” (<i>Orat.</i> xliii. 21—Monody on his son’s death).
But this is rather late in the history of Neo-Platonism. What about
Plotinus, and Porphyry, and Proclus? Trench gives no references in
proof of his statement, and we have been unable to find any.</p>

But as it is raised above everything in its nature, and needs
nothing external, it cannot communicate itself substantially to another,
nor make the creation of another its object. Creation cannot, as with
the Stoics, be regarded as the communication of the Divine Nature,
as a partial transference of it into the derivative creature; nor can it
be conceived as an act of will. But Plotinus cannot succeed in uniting
these determinations in a clear and consistent conception. He has
recourse, therefore, to metaphors.”—<span class="smcap">Zeller.</span></p>
